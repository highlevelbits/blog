    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon a great post over at &lt;a href="http://www.farnamstreetblog.com/"&gt;Farnam Street&lt;/a&gt; pointing out the importance of making mistakes. Nothing new here but really good to get a reminder now and then:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Just because we’ve lost our way doesn’t mean that we are lost forever. In the end, it’s not the failures that define us so much as how we respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I got a request for recruitment by email. And as usual the recruiter has determined that I fit a certain role very well. In this case and as always there are no consideration whether the role fits me. Here is an excerpt from the mail conversation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote style="font-style: normal;"&gt;
&lt;p style="border-left: solid; padding-left: 3px; font-family: Courier New"&gt;
I believe that your profile matches the requirements for this role. And
I´am contacting you to hear if this role is consistent with your
background, and if so, are you interested to be presented to my client?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-family: Courier New"&gt;
It is indeed true that my profile matches this role. Also important to
figure out is if the role matches me. (A thing recruiters seldom
consider.) And in this case (as with a large number of similar requests
over the years) it does not. Going from freelancing to being an employed
gun for hire is not tempting at all.

    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.highlevelbits.com/2014/09/berlin.html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I have spent a couple of days in Berlin. Due to its sad history the feeling I get in Berlin is that of a broken city. The former central parts that has been revitalized feels artificial. I am looking at you, Potsdamer Platz. The city seems to have many centers rather than one. The city isn’t one yet. But it is working hard to get there. Much construction. But also lost areas that no one will care for in a very long time. It is a city of progress and the future it belongs to. Contrary to cities like Paris and Stockholm it can still shape its destiny. This is probably why it has such traction among startups. So I like many things about Berlin and since it is election times in Sweden I give you a list of things that we should pick up back in Stockholm. Most of it concerning public transportation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;public transportation can be cheap. A one day ticket is €6.70 - a bit more than a long distance single ticket in Stockholm.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;public transportation does not need to have barriers. I guess this means that more people travel for free but on other hand it feels very inclusive. Like public transportation is part of the city.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there can be &lt;em&gt;fika&lt;/em&gt; in the subway.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it is possible to bring bicycles in subway wagons smaller than stockholm ones.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there can be enough public transportation. Not once was a train overfull despite traveling during rush hours. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there can be different kinds of street food available for around €3-5. But it probably can’t in Sweden because taxes…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a tasty beer typically lets you back some 3 or 4 euros. That is about half… Probably taxes in the way again…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll leave you with &lt;a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/carst/4177229/"&gt;this nice shot&lt;/a&gt; of the berliner subway by &lt;a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/carst/"&gt;Carst van der Molen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here I am finding myself in between gigs in september. What to do? Of course, the main javascript event (jsconf.eu) has been sold out for ages. But it turns out that there is a &lt;a href="http://jsfest.berlin/"&gt;javascript fest&lt;/a&gt; going on the entire week as a precursor to the main event. So I swiftly booked myself on &lt;a href="http://lanyrd.com/2014/decentralizejs/"&gt;decentralize.js&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://rejectjs.org/"&gt;reject.js&lt;/a&gt; and also made sure that I get a couple of days to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; Berlin. Here are some thoughts from decentralize.js. There may or may not appear a similar post about reject.js…..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When thinking about the current state of the web and also about where we are headed - this may be the most important event anywhere at the moment. The trend we have been seeing the last 15 years when we willingly give our own data away to for-profit companies to whatever they please with is distressing to say the least. I &lt;a href="/2013/08/freedom.html"&gt;mumbled about&lt;/a&gt; this a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some 20 devs turned up at the really cool &lt;a href="http://www.betahaus.com/berlin/"&gt;betahaus cafe&lt;/a&gt;. Some getaways from this event:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;webrtc removes the need for a server when doing p2p real time interaction in the browser. Useful for any streaming between clients.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) has been around for ages and it is really cool. Albeit XML based it has all the things needed to decentralize micro messaging. Actually many proprietary solutions are based on XMPP but are not advertising it - for apparent reasons. It certainly looks possible to have a email like infrastructure for this if major &lt;em&gt;private&lt;/em&gt; players (like facebook, twitter and skype) would make up their minds. Shame on you….&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href="https://unhosted.org/"&gt;unhosted&lt;/a&gt; stuff is moving along. The problem of decentralizing storage is addressed with the &lt;a href="http://remotestorage.io/"&gt;remoteStorage protocol&lt;/a&gt;. There is also a messaging service thing called &lt;a href="http://sockethub.org/"&gt;sockethub&lt;/a&gt; that aims to make it easy to send messages to any platform out there. It takes a practical approach to the problem aiming for something that can be useful today. It feels a bit off to have a hub for doing this. It is probably needed at the moment but I feel that this kind of thing should be a part of the internet infrastructure of tomorrow. Sending a message should just be a matter of addressing. Just like email.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These things are increasingly important if we are ever are gonna get a nice open and free internet. I am really happy that people are working on this and a bit sad that I haven’t been able to contribute in anyway myself.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Hero Driven Development - and what you can do about it</title>
    <published>2014-08-19T22:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2014-08-19T22:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.highlevelbits.com/2014/08/hero-driven-development.html"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It happens rather often that I found myself in a negative organizational pattern that I will call &lt;em&gt;hero driven development&lt;/em&gt; in this post. It has several other names: I often call it &lt;em&gt;firefighting&lt;/em&gt; and I have also seen &lt;em&gt;dragon slayer&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;cowboy shooting from the hip&lt;/em&gt;. I am sure there are other names. Add yours in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/117/384464432_e373fb5f2d_o.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main characteristics of this pattern:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a significant hoarded technical debt.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a select few able to deal with that debt.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;business as usual&lt;/em&gt; is not normally premiered.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the technical debt causes regular crises. A system goes down, some important functionality is broken or something like this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a hero puts his &lt;em&gt;ordinary&lt;/em&gt; work aside for a while and gloriously solves the crises, slays the dragon and puts out the fire.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;everyone is happy until the next crises.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a deficit in reflective exercises ensures that it happens again soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what can we do about it? It is hard to change an organization that has settled on this pattern. The satisfaction of saving the organization whenever there is a crises is impossible to match with &lt;em&gt;business as usual&lt;/em&gt;. It is also important to recognize that this kind of culture rarely is explicit. When asked, no one likes the cycle of crises and salvation. It is stuck on a subconscious level. Here are a number of things to focus on if you find yourself inside this pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="team-solves-crises"&gt;Team solves crises&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main problem with hero driven development is that single individuals step in and solve crises when needed. They may even often come from outside the team that normally should be responsible for solving the crises. Decide that the responsibility for solving any crises is the entire team. Make these tasks visible in/on whatever tool you are using for task management. (Preferably a physical board…..)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="pairing"&gt;Pairing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good strategy for the long term. If all work happens in pairs the knowledge needed for solving a crises will slowly spread throughout the team. It is also a good tactic for the short term. Decide that no hero solves a crises on his/her own but has to work with someone else so solve it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="insist-on-retrospectives"&gt;Insist on retrospectives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a pattern like this settles itself solidly it often proves hard to change it. Whenever a crises has been solved, everyone just moves forward, without reflecting on changes to avoid a similar crises in the future. To make the hero pattern visible, retrospectives can be a good tool. Focus on what to improve rather than the failure that caused the crises. Pick one or two things to improve in whatever time frame you are working in. Two weeks may be a good interval. Also, keep retrospectives short. An hour is enough if they are done regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="acknowledge-hero-skills"&gt;Acknowledge hero skills&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to acknowledge that the heroes excellent skills is not a problem, it is an asset. Find a way to make sure that this skill set comes to good use when working to avoid future crises. Heroes may feel threatened by the disappearance of his/her natural arena. Try to create another arena for the hero to excel in his/her brilliancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="workplace-locations"&gt;Workplace locations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral patterns like hero driven development can be inhibited by a conscious placement of workplaces. Put people that can benefit from each other together. Don’t keep the same placement for long periods of time. Changes means that new constellations of people can start interact naturally. Where to put the hero? It probably depends a bit on how you want to solve crises further on. If the hero will be involved than he/she should be located in the midst of things. If not, located out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, never put several heroes together - spread them out as far away from each other as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="make-the-technical-debt-visible-and-start-reducing-it"&gt;Make the technical debt visible and start reducing it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need for a hero is often caused by an unmanaged technical debt. Try to make this debt as visible as possible in the form of tasks that can be done. They should be as small as possible. This may be really hard but given some thought it is often possible to break the work into smaller bits. When a crises happens, try to think of what parts of the technical debt that caused it and try to prioritize those tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If nothing else, a start can be to put automated tests on vital parts of the system. It is good for many things:
- it gives you feedback about how the system is feeling
- it makes it possible to refactor
- it increases the understanding, good tests can double as documentation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="measure-absence-of-crises"&gt;Measure absence of crises&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally - it is crises we want to avoid. Introduce metrics. It can be uptime, availability, number of crises a week, magnitude of a crises and so forth. Visibility of progress is very important. This is especially true in an organization that normally don’t acknowledge &lt;em&gt;business as usual&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
