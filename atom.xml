    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Time to move on to the bright (old) new world of static sites. We were not
entirely satisfied with drupal. Not knowing (or wanting to know) the platform
well enough made us unable to produce the awesome site we want high level bits to be.
In comes &lt;a href="http://nanoc.ws/"&gt;nanoc&lt;/a&gt; - what you read here is generated by nanoc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The source is now &lt;a href="https://github.com/highlevelbits/blog"&gt;all available at github&lt;/a&gt; so if you want to
contribute a post just clone and pull request away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started by exporting our data from Drupal with &lt;a href="https://github.com/highlevelbits/blog/blob/master/import.rb"&gt;this little Ruby script&lt;/a&gt;
that connects directly with the
drupal database and creates posts and appends old comments to the post. It also updates the
head section with title, timestamp and author. We decided to skip exporting of tags and do a retagging of all
the articles. Well worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The natural choice for hosting is &lt;a href="http://pages.github.com/"&gt;github pages&lt;/a&gt;. It turned out to be rather easy to setup with nanoc.
There was no documentation for how to do it with nanoc so I added a
&lt;a href="https://github.com/froderik/nanoc-site/blob/master/content/docs/guides/deploying-nanoc-sites.md#with-github-pages"&gt;section to the deploy guide&lt;/a&gt;.
(Yet to make it into the main docs.) The instructions in the github docs are straightforward. A little script
automates the deploy procedure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#! /usr/bin/env bash

nanoc prune compile --yes
cd output
git pull origin gh-pages
git add .
git commit -am "high level bits automatic deploy"
git push origin gh-pages
cd ..
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To choose nanoc more or less just happened. I asked a bit on twitter and got nanoc is nice back and started
to play with it. It is nice and so here we are. Hardy had good experiences with awestruct but since he had
less time at the moment I just moved forward with nanoc to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All articles have been retagged so hopefully tags make more sense now. We don’t have a tags page anymore. Instead
posts with similar tags are shown at the bottom of the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/archive.html"&gt;archive page&lt;/a&gt; was fun to build. I decided to try to do foldable sections without using javascript using the checkbox
trick. Check the code to find out how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I had in mind a series of posts about our trip to the far east but I realize that it will not happen with everything else that is happening now. So I will settle on writing a bit about the culture of Japan and Korea. Beer in mind that we only spent about 3 weeks in total so there is plenty of room for misunderstandings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7089/6965682494_87406a6cf0.jpg" alt="harajuku" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that went missing when leaving Japan is polite and smiling people. In almost every shop you are welcomed by a smiling person that says something to you. Back in Sweden it is rather the exception. Also when looking lost in a street corner with a map there is always someone trying to help. This was even more apparent in Korea than in Japan. Seoul was a bit friendlier in this resepect compared to Japan. All in all I don’t think we met a single person that was not friendly during the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The low tax on income makes it worthwhile to have small businesses which makes cities much more lively. There are so many small enterprises in both Japan and Korea that makes the countries more alive. It is also something that makes it easier to find something to eat. And yes - the food is awesome. Japanese food is of course about the fish and the rice which we had plenty. But it is also about yakitori, ramen and udon. One of the best meals was a lunch in Kyoto where we got noodles on a fry bench (griddles? - a bit lost about the english word for this….). Korean cuisine may not be that famous in the west but stands up really good. It is not only about the kimchi and it is certainly not just spicy chilliish food as the guide book said. Korean BBQ is often prepared at the table by the guests or by a chef. With meat of good quality and all the nice side dishes it makes for a really intimate way to share a meal. We also took a liking to korean breakfast. It is much the same as a “normal” meal but in smaller quantities. The kimchi and the ever present soup is there and maybe one smaller dish with meat or fish. Also - the ever present cup of tasty green tea. The only thing to grow tired of is all that rice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7055/7053758185_b0364ae8a5.jpg" alt="udon" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From food it is easy to move on to cleanliness. Most restaurants give you warm or cold small wet towels to clean yourself before starting to eat. Such a nice thing to start every meal feeling refreshed especially after a couple of hours of sightseeing. Another great thing about these countries are restrooms everywhere. Every building in Japan seem to have a tidy public restroom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did a bit of sampling of the Japanese onsen (bathing) culture. In Beppu we stayed at a hotel with a couple of private baths that you could book for free by the hour. True balm for the soul to sit in these warm baths and just exist for a while. We could have done much more of this side of Japan but so much to see and just 3 weeks to spend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice trip and there may be more of the far east soon. Käthes youngest daughter is about to study in Shanghai for a year so maybe we will “have to” visit her around christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

Food, baths and sauna. My passions. I think I need to plan a trip to Japan as well :-)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Time to post something on our new blog as well - and yes, I am still alive :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about running. I know, I know, I used to say that last year’s &lt;a href="http://www.highlevelbits.com/2011/09/38-berlin-marathon-and-my-first.html"&gt;Berlin Marathon&lt;/a&gt; was a once off: “I just want to see whether I can run a marathon.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now in 2012 I am already signed up for &lt;a href="http://www.goteborgsvarvet.se/"&gt;Göteborgs Varvet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.stockholmmarathon.se/Start/index.cfm?Lan_ID=3"&gt;Stockholm Marathon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.midnattsloppet.com"&gt;Midnattsloppet&lt;/a&gt;. What exactly my goal is I am not sure, but I know I am not there yet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to talk equipment tough. As with any good sport, it is all about the equipment and one important piece of running equipment (give or take the shoes) is the pulse clock. Luckily I got a Polar RS300X as a Christmas present and I like it a lot. However, as any gadget loving nerd I could not stop there. For training purposes it might be enough to know in which pulse range I am running in, but my alter ego needs to know distances. Kilometers are what counts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I needed was either a GPS based Polar G1 or the Polar foot pod S1. For me the choice seemed easy. Something with a GPS in it must be so much better than a step counting thingy (I just had this little clip-ons in mind you put on your pants). However, if I would have done my research better I would have quickly learned that the S1 is much more accurate than the G1 and that you can actually start running without delay. With the G1 you sometimes have to wait several minutes before it has a signal and if you are lucky you keep the signal for the whole run (often you don’t and wonder in the end why it felt you ran 10km, but the G1 only shows 5km). You also cannot download the actual track you were running. The G1 only measures the total distance!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest frustration with the G1 I had, however, a couple of weeks ago. In the middle of the run the battery died. It was not the first time, but fair enough I could have replaced the battery earlier. The problem was, however, that once at home and with a new battery inside, the G1 refused to restart. I would turn it on and it would blink, just to turn of after about a minute. Replacing the battery did not help. There was no reset button and the manual did not mention anything like it. Even googling I drew a blank (note to self, there are questions Google does not have an answer to) My G1 was “broken”. In the end a friend helped me with the solution. Whether I already had tried to take out the battery for a longer time and then place it back in. I am still unclear about where the difference is between just changing the the battery or taking it out, leaving the G1 without a battery for a while and then placing in a new one, BUT that was the solution. Why can Polar not write this into the manual I wonder!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy running,
Hardy&lt;/p&gt;

Before I always brought my smart phone with me to get time and distance but this is much better and I can also get the pulse. The only downside is that the internal chargeable battery runs out when it is not used for some time. You are supposed to run at least every two weeks apparently. Have been thinking about a 10k race this year. Earlier today I ran 7k in about 44 minutes so with a bit more training I should be able to run 10k under the hour.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="one-old-comment"&gt;&lt;span class="comment-date"&gt;2012-08-18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="commenter-name"&gt;TrierfepeSith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="comment-body"&gt;Did you already know about it?!

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/f-l-e-x/3096005116"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3070/3096005116_83a31d1fee.jpg" alt="HTML" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had the questionable fortune to code a bit of web using &lt;a href="http://www.java.com/"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt; technologies the last months. Not my choice of tech obviously but nevertheless interesting. Much has happened in the Java space since the days of &lt;a href="http://struts.apache.org/"&gt;Struts&lt;/a&gt; - I remember doing stuff on an early beta back in 2001. It was much better than coding servlets directly. We have gone a long way since then and these days Java or the microsoft techs are not the obvious choice anymore. People are being much more productive with Ruby, Python, Groovy, Scala and even Smalltalk these days. A much better world for us developers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway - this new phase started with a bit of &lt;a href="https://vaadin.com"&gt;Vaadin&lt;/a&gt;. It is built using the same technology as in &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/"&gt;GWT&lt;/a&gt; but more backendish. You code in Java and markup, scripts and styling just appear magically in your browser. It works fine as long as you stick to the box. I was lucky to work with &lt;a href="http://blog.crisp.se/author/magnusaxelqvist"&gt;Magnus Axelqvist&lt;/a&gt; - also a proponent of test driving and we really tried hard to do black boxing of our app using Fitnesse (as well as the fair amount of “normal” unit tests). And now dark clouds started to appear. Everything in Vaadin becomes embedded in a multitude of div elements and only some of them get an appropriate css id. What is worse though is that it is hard if not impossible to set the id yourself. The default implementation of common form widgets keeps state somewhere in the javascript engine and not visible from the outside making it impossible to get the value of a drop. We had to use a “native” implementation to get around it. A positive on the other hand is that it is very easy to write unit tests for the Java code. Although it doesn’t test the Java-&amp;gt;HTML transformation it gives you enough security when TDDing your application. Vaadin is probably a good choice when your developer group is skilled in Java but not in web but a lot of flexibility is given away to the framework. I would not consider it for end user apps but it may work well for in house administrative stuff where functionality is more important than looks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Vaadin experience it was nice to get introduced to &lt;a href="http://wicket.apache.org/"&gt;Wicket&lt;/a&gt; - a framework with a kind of templates (actually plain HTML files spiced up with wicket:id attributes) and most of the coding still done in Java. A bit of Ajax generated in the background but still possible to hook in your own javascripts when necessary. Although it is painful to write web applications in Java, Wicket is an option where you still have lots of control over your markup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wonderlane/2105227208"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2121/2105227208_44e1536453.jpg" alt="markup" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trip made me realize that the core of the web is in the markup. HTML, Javascript and CSS is what matters in the browser. Please try to learn it instead of hiding behind a framework that takes away your markup ownership. If you are to build smashing applications for the web you need to control your markup.&lt;/p&gt;
