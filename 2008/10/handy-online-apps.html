Hi,<br /><br />here are two simple online applications I find myself returning to. The first is a Unicode converter. There are many Unicode conversion tables out there, but they many times only convert between two different encodings, eg between UTF-8 character and Decimal NCR. Give <a href="http://rishida.net/scripts/uniview/conversion.php">Unicode Code Converter v6</a> a go I am sure it will have the right answer for you :).<br /><br />The second application I wanted to mention is <a href="http://www.sqlinform.com/">SQLinForm</a>. It is an excellent online SQL formatter which can also handle SQL embedded in Java code. SQLinForm is also used inernally by <a href="http://www.minq.se/products/dbvis/">DbVisualizer</a> another irreplacabe tool in my toolbox. It is not as poweful as specialised tools like Toad, but on the other hand it allows me to connect to any database I have a JDBC driver for.<br /><br />So long,<br />--Hardy
