<p>Using a rolling distribution like Arch is good in many ways but when things you really 
need start to break it is not so fun. I have had some problems with steam - a thing
I really need in order to play games! (Yes - priorities are rightly ordered!) Apparently
steam comes with a couple of libraries that sooner or later will become older than the once
installed in the OS. My error looks like this:</p>

<p><code>
Running Steam on arch rolling 64-bit
STEAM_RUNTIME is enabled automatically
Installing breakpad exception handler for appid(steam)/version(1467926999)
libGL error: unable to load driver: i965_dri.so
libGL error: driver pointer missing
libGL error: failed to load driver: i965
libGL error: unable to load driver: swrast_dri.so
libGL error: failed to load driver: swrast
</code></p>

<p>After googling for quite a while and trying a couple of things I stumbled upon 
<a href="http://wyldeplayground.net/steam-unable-to-load-driver-i965_dri-so-intel-graphics/">this problem solver</a>.
It made sense to me directly. The post is essentially one line:</p>

<pre><code>LD_PRELOAD='/usr/lib32/libstdc++.so.6 /usr/lib32/libgcc_s.so.1 /usr/lib32/libxcb.so.1 /usr/lib32/libgpg-error.so' steam
</code></pre>

<p>LD_PRELOAD is a way to load some objects before others. In this case we tell steam to use these 4 libraries 
instead of its own. Problem solved and I can move on to more important things currently as the King of Finland
in the <a href="http://www.crusaderkings.com/">Crusader Kings</a> year 987. I am about to turn this tribe into a merchant republic!</p>
