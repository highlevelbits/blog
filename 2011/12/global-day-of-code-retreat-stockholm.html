<p><b><span style="font-size: large;">General ideas </span></b><br><br>I am on the train back to Göteborg from <a href="http://highlevelbits-ferentschik.rhcloud.com/sites/default/files/sites/default/files/images">Emily Bache</a>. In the final retrospect of the evening I already mentioned the following ideas to spice up upcoming code retreats </p>
<ul>
<li>randomize pairs</li>
<li>have multiple problems <a href="http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataCatalogue">katas</a> or at least change the problem for the next event</li>
<li>offer partly implemented projects for the problems (in different languages). This way one can also practice how to evolve existing software. Challenges could be to continue projects with bad or no tests. What do you then? Green field development is great, but is not spotted so often in the wild than the extension/maintenance based development. It is important to also hone your skills of working and improving an existing code base.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Some  thoughts on TDD</b></span><br><br>The biggest focus during the whole event was on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a>. I am a strong believer in writing tests and very (very) rarely I commit a functional change without a test, however, I am not religious about whether to write tests first or not. It depends on the situation.<br><br>It was nice to to some TDD, but some things I saw still got me wondering. We implemented <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a> and a quite common approach I've seen in the iterations was to implementing the different (arguably quite simple) game rules. Often one single rule was taken, a test for just this single rule was added and then implemented. The implementation was supposed to just pass, often by initially returning hard coded values. Then a new test was added for the second rule and the implementation changed accordingly. Depending on your level of dummy implemenations you now have to revisit again your first test and implementation, and so on ...<br><br>I am wondering whether this is really the intention of TDD. For me there is too much mocking going on. The rules for the Game of Life are quite simple and in my opinion can be implemented in one go. You can still write the tests up front, but why not write <i>all</i> basic tests for the four rules up front and then implement the logic? Does TDD really mean that you have to break down a problem sentence by sentence? Is it really forbidden to implement "more" than required, knowing that you will need it a few minutes down the track anyways? Part of being/becoming an expert is that you are (compared to a novice) able to manage a bigger scoped problems. Breaking down problems is good, but as with everything a balance has to be found here as well.<br><br>I also think there is still room and more importantly value in hacking/spiking sessions. Again a balance is needed. For writing production code TDD is a very good method, but it is not so suited for investigating solutions for a problem. A spike to explore the problem space can be helpful and most importantly <b>fun</b>. In one session I was just quickly exploring in ruby on how to actually display the game using <a href="http://rmagick.rubyforge.org/">Rmagick</a> to generate animated gifs. It was heaps of fun and a very welcome break of all the disciplined work in the other iterations.<br><br><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Misc</b></span><br><br>Last but not least, a OO thought. Due to my Java background I naturally tackle most problems in an OO way. In one session though I was the co-pilot and we went for a solution (in ruby) without classes and a very compact data structure for the problem using arrays and maps. I found even thinking about the problem was made much harder, since all was so abstract. There is a certain level of self documentation when you just see names (classes) like Cell and Habitat. It helps your brain to tackle the problem. Advanced data structures are good and maybe sometimes required, but it is definitely a good thing, if you can hide this complexity behind simpler interfaces and classes :-)<br><br>Overall a very productive and enjoyable day. Thanks <a href="http://coreyhaines.com/">Corey Haines</a> for the idea of code retreats.<br><br>--Hardy</p>

Wouldn't mind seeing a solution with mocking if you've got one around.<br><br>I wouldn't hesitate to do something else than tdd on a code retreat, after all they're for experimenting with things we don't do or do differently every day. <br><br>Finally about OO vs functional. Did you ever try using typed data, something like clojure's records? especially when mixed with protocols they provide basically the same semantic help as oo languages (with some additional beaty ofcourse :))</div>

Maybe dummy methods would have been a better name.

It would be nice<br>to experiment with typed data and clojure. I am tempted to do the game of life in Erlang also, but so far only read the Erlang Getting Started tutorial. Now it would be time to get my hands dirty ;-)</div>

<span class="comment-date">2011-12-09</span><span class="commenter-name">Fredrik Rubensson</span><div class="comment-body">If you think about specs instead of tests it may feel better to just write enough of code to make them pass. (Even if it is a hard coded return value.) If you write more you are just speculating and putting time into possible waste. Personally I think it is more valuable to do spec first on the integration test level then on the unit test level. When unit testing - "test first" is more about driving the design and keeping complexity low.<br><br>I have been writing more black box, high level tests than unit tests lately. It is more satisfying since it gives me a clear "definition of done". Tricky low level code still always get unit tests though.<br><br>Peter Lind said that Valtech will do a legacy code retreat next year!</div>

<span class="comment-date">2011-12-09</span><span class="commenter-name">Fredrik Rubensson</span><div class="comment-body">Oops - forgot an insight from the code retreat. The purpose of code retreats as a concept was to get more people to do testing AT ALL. The thing is that most people coming to a code retreat probably write tests already and may learn more from doing something completely different.</div>
