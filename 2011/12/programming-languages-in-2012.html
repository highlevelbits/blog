<p>A new year is about to be born and it is time to make vows and predictions. Here is my take on programming languages in 2012 and what I will try to do with them.<br><br><strong>Java</strong> will stay around for much longer just as <strong>Cobol</strong> has been around for ages. There has been much buzz in the business about <strong>Scala</strong> being the replacement of Java. I don't think it will happen in 2012. I am not sure Scala will be the next Java either. Java is a language where you can only do things in a few ways. This is a huge benefit for organisations that can not be sure their developers will stick around. A switch to Scala would make it much harder to get into a typical code base with many authors over several years. A nice and clean Scala system with a bit of code conventions would be a bliss to work with. So for enterprise software Java and its microsoft siblings will stay strong for yet some time.<br><br>I don't think 2012 is the year when developers start writing tests so I certainly hope that nice dynamic languages like <strong>Ruby</strong>, <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Smalltalk</strong> will not enter the stage in any big way. But if they do lets pray that it is with developers that test.<br><br>Functional programming will continue to come back and this will move Scala (again) and <strong>erlang</strong> forward. <strong>Haskell</strong> is a bit too obscure to count.<br><br>I also predict that <strong>C</strong> will come back a little due to arduino and other stuff like that. Try to taste "domain specific languages in C".<br><br>One dynamic languages that will continue to shine is of course <strong>javascript</strong>. As code moves from the backend to the browser javascript will rise and shine. It is not that bad a language but it got several nasty traps for the newcomer. The only hope for a Javascript alternative comes from <strong>Coffeescript</strong>. Lets pray for native browser support in firefox during 2012. (I guess chrome is busy fiddling with that strange <strong>dart</strong>.) We will also see much more backend javascript during the year. node.js is here to stay and it will mature and become a serious option even for more conservative shops.<br><br>So what will I do with this knowledge in the year to come. This year I have become fluent in Ruby so I will continue to use it for backend stuff. I have also learned more Javascript and will continue down that path. The new language I will try to pick up is Coffescript. It looks much more joyful to code in than Javascript and may also be useful for testing. I guess I will do some Java also. It will feel nostalgic now that I haven't touched it for quite a while.</p>

I think domain specific languages in C is an intriguing idea. I like C a lot more than C++, because of its simplicity :) I would not be surprised if Google move from Java to Dart on Android, Dart is how Java should have been designed in the first place :) But it is a poor successor of JavaScript :( I just read an entertaining actitle about the history of Lisp at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, with some interesting remarks on Java :) <a href="http://www.flownet.com/gat/jpl-lisp.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.flownet.com/gat/jpl-lisp.html</a>
