  My favorite iPad apps

For some time now I call myself a proud iPad owner and I thought it is time to summarize my favorite apps (the equivalent to <a href="http://www.highlevelbits.com/2010/06/my-favorite-android-apps.html">my favorite Android apps</a>).<br><br>First some general words about my iPad though. I am very happy about this buy. Much happier than with my HTC Desire. Obviously they are different gadgets, but contrary to my phone where I had to give up battery life and calling comfort in exchange for apps, the iPad only opened up new possibilities. Some daily tasks like emailing or news reading are a real pleasure on the iPad.  <br><br>One thing I hate though is that I don't have access to the file system. Some of you (including Neal Ford in his <a href="http://www.jfokus.se/jfokus11/preso/jf11_AbstractionDistractions.pdf">Abstraction Distraction talk</a>) will tell me that file systems are so yesterday. However, I beg to differ. I think file systems are a perfect abstraction. They are like the drawers in my house. I just know in which one to look. Besides, with access to a file system the problem of disappearing space described in this <a href="http://brucefwebster.com/2011/02/28/curious-ipad-behavior/">blog</a> would be much easier to track. As long as we are building on top of operating systems with file systems, power users want to have access to it and be it via a custom app.<br><br>Related to this, I hate that I don't have full control on how and what to sync from and to my iPad. For some reason iTunes, iPhoto &amp; Co think they know better than I where to place things. This sucks!<br><br>Anyways, this was not supposed to become a rant about the iPad. Without further ado, here are my favorite apps (all available from the App Store):<br><ul>
<li>Dropbox (a service I am used to on all platforms now)</li>
<li>GoodReader (perfect for organizing your pdf libraries and syncs likely with Dropbox)</li>
<li>Flipboard (how much fun RSS, twitter and Facebook can be)</li>
<li>CineXPlayer (avi player)</li>
<li>Maps (best standard app)</li>
<li>Mail (great standard app as well)</li>
<li>MyPad (nice Facebook app)</li>
<li>TripAdvisor (better than the play web version - nicely done!)</li>
<li>TED (watch TED videos)</li>
</ul>Enjoy,<br>Hardy<div class="old-comments">

Another one of my favs is TV Everywhere with DISH Network. It's cool because as a subscriber/employee of DISH Network I can use my iPad as a portable TV. With the help of the Sling Adapter it lets me view all my subscribed live and recorded TV anywhere I go. I love it! Plus don't forget those Angry Birds! Lol. That game is just so addicting! :)</div>

The whole hype is not quite understandable to me. I wonder if people really spend so much time playing it or if they just say they do, because other say they do ;-)</div>
