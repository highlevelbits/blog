This time I experimented with <a href=\"http://drupal.org/\">Drupal</a> based on this <a href=\"https://github.com/openshift/drupal-example\">template</a>.<br /><br />After a slightly bumpy start and a quick <a href=\"https://github.com/openshift/drupal-example/pull/3\">pull request</a> I got the basic installation up and running. One problem I encountered now, however, was that there is no easy way to manage data created by the application once running.<br /><br />For example, Drupal users can upload images (per default into <i>sites/default/files</i>). Naturally I would like to add these uploaded resources under version control as well. However, that&#39;s not possible at the moment. OpenShift Express had the notion of a <i><b>OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR</b></i> directory whose content is preserved between redeploys, but this directory is outside of the git repository. What I really want is to be able to use the same resource directory for my local development as well as on the remote site and manage the resources via git.<br /><br />Locally I can add resources created in <i>sites/default/files </i>directly to git, but how to solve this on the sever side? The first problem I had, which I already encountered when installing <a href=\"http://www.highlevelbits.com/2011/11/gollum-wiki-reloaded.html\">Gollum</a> on OpenShift, was that the repo directory from which the application is run from is not a git <a href=\"http://linux.die.net/man/1/git-clone\">clone</a>, but an git <a href=\"http://linux.die.net/man/1/git-archive\">archive</a> which means that there are no git control files. If <i><b>OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR</b></i> were a git clone I could somehow add created files to the git repo, commit, push and finally pull it into my local environment. Unfortunately, the OpenShift gang decided for now against a full git clone mainly (afaik) due to size concerns. The good news is that there is a way to fix this yourself with some lines in the <i>.openshift/action_hooks/build</i> hook:</p>
<pre class=\"code\">
cd $OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR/$OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME/runtime
rm -rf repo
git clone $OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR/git/$OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME.git repo 
</pre>
<p>This will delete the git archive and and replace it with a git clone. This is of course only half the rent. Somehow you need to add and commit new content on the server side. One way is to add some more code to the build hook,but so far I went with another simpler solution. I just <i>ssh</i> into onto the remote server.&nbsp; As far as I know this was not always possible, but it is now. Just check your git remote url via <i>git remote -v</i> or <i>rhc-user-info</i>.The former will display something like:</p>
<pre class=\"code\">
ssh://&lt;uuid&gt;@&lt;app-name&gt;-&lt;domain&gt;.rhcloud.com/~/git/&lt;app-name&gt;.git
</pre>
<p>To ssh to your app use:</p>
<pre class=\"code\">
ssh &lt;uuid&gt;@&lt;app-name&gt;-&lt;domain&gt;
</pre>
<p>Once you are on the server you can change into <i><b>OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR</b></i> run your git commands and finally git push. Once you&#39;ve done that you can do a git pull from your local machine. The disadvatange of this method is that a git push on the remote server is of course running the git hooks meaning you are forcing a redeploy. Whether this is a bad thing depends on the usecase. An alternative could be to use scp to copy new resources to the local machine and then add them there, but of course you would need a way to determine what to copy.<br /><br />As you can see, I am also still figuring things out. I haven&#39;t yet found an approach I am really happy with, but I am getting there :-) Let me know what you think.<br /><br />--Hardy<br /><br />P.S. For the Mac developers out there. To develop my Drupal app locally using the default Apache server I added the following to <i>/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist</i>:<br />&nbsp;</p>
<pre class=\"code\">
&lt;!--?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?--&gt;

&lt;plist version=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt;
&lt;dict&gt;
        ...
        &lt;string&gt;system.preferences&lt;/string&gt;
        &lt;key&gt;EnvironmentVariables&lt;/key&gt;
        &lt;dict&gt;
                &lt;key&gt;OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME&lt;/key&gt;
                &lt;string&gt;myapp&lt;/string&gt;
                &lt;key&gt;OPENSHIFT_DB_USERNAME&lt;/key&gt;
                &lt;string&gt;mydbuser&lt;/string&gt;
                &lt;key&gt;OPENSHIFT_DB_PASSWORD&lt;/key&gt;
                &lt;string&gt;mydbpass&lt;/string&gt;
                &lt;key&gt;OPENSHIFT_DB_HOST&lt;/key&gt;
                &lt;string&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/string&gt;
                &lt;key&gt;OPENSHIFT_DB_PORT&lt;/key&gt;
                &lt;string&gt;3306&lt;/string&gt;
        &lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/plist&gt;

<p>This way I can develop my Drupal application locally without making any changes to <i>settings.php</i> in <i>php/sites/default</i> which contains the database connection settings.</p>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 201,"revision_id": 201,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "<p>A new year is about to be born and it is time to make vows and predictions. Here is my take on programming languages in 2012 and what I will try to do with them.<br /><br /><strong>Java</strong> will stay around for much longer just as <strong>Cobol</strong> has been around for ages. There has been much buzz in the business about <strong>Scala</strong> being the replacement of Java. I don&#39;t think it will happen in 2012. I am not sure Scala will be the next Java either. Java is a language where you can only do things in a few ways. This is a huge benefit for organisations that can not be sure their developers will stick around. A switch to Scala would make it much harder to get into a typical code base with many authors over several years. A nice and clean Scala system with a bit of code conventions would be a bliss to work with. So for enterprise software Java and its microsoft siblings will stay strong for yet some time.<br /><br />I don&#39;t think 2012 is the year when developers start writing tests so I certainly hope that nice dynamic languages like <strong>Ruby</strong>, <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Smalltalk</strong> will not enter the stage in any big way. But if they do lets pray that it is with developers that test.<br /><br />Functional programming will continue to come back and this will move Scala (again) and <strong>erlang</strong> forward. <strong>Haskell</strong> is a bit too obscure to count.<br /><br />I also predict that <strong>C</strong> will come back a little due to arduino and other stuff like that. Try to taste &quot;domain specific languages in C&quot;.<br /><br />One dynamic languages that will continue to shine is of course <strong>javascript</strong>. As code moves from the backend to the browser javascript will rise and shine. It is not that bad a language but it got several nasty traps for the newcomer. The only hope for a Javascript alternative comes from <strong>Coffeescript</strong>. Lets pray for native browser support in firefox during 2012. (I guess chrome is busy fiddling with that strange <strong>dart</strong>.) We will also see much more backend javascript during the year. node.js is here to stay and it will mature and become a serious option even for more conservative shops.<br /><br />So what will I do with this knowledge in the year to come. This year I have become fluent in Ruby so I will continue to use it for backend stuff. I have also learned more Javascript and will continue down that path. The new language I will try to pick up is Coffescript. It looks much more joyful to code in than Javascript and may also be useful for testing. I guess I will do some Java also. It will feel nostalgic now that I haven&#39;t touched it for quite a while.</p>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 202,"revision_id": 202,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "Are you still looking for a Christmas present? It might not be too late to get a copy of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Tiger\">The Wild Tiger</a>, the debut album of Aravind Adiga. If not the best book I read this year, it was definitely the most entertaining. It gives a great insight into modern India and I really got sucked into the story. I don\'t want to write a long summary or get too much into reviewing. If you want to know more, just read the wikipedia <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Tiger\">entry</a> or even better get your own copy.The interesting bit for me was, how reading this book brought back memories of another great - <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Swans\">Wild Swans</a> by Jung Chang. Even though both book differ greatly in their form of delivery and even though one is about India and the other about China, both capture the reader completely and deliver great insights. We learn ways to little about the Asian countries in our European upbringing. At least that\'s my experience :-(<br/>If you know any of these two books and can recommend something similar, let me know. If you don\'t know them, go and get them. You won\'t be disappointed.

It is a new area for me so it has been both frustrating and interesting. The frustration comes from the many dead ends it is possible to walk mindlessly into. The interestingness comes of course from the opportunity to learn new stuff.<br /><br />My customer does not have &quot;big data&quot; with row counts in the millions rather than the billions. They get by with a relational database with no problem at all. My task has been to extract data from the relational database and put it in a business intelligence tool to enable ease of reports creation. We choose to develop a proof of concept with <a href=\"http://www.gooddata.com/\">GoodData</a> a SaaS (Software as a Service) vendor in the business intelligence sector. They are on a <a href=\"http://www.gooddata.com/about/romans-vision\">mission to redefine</a> the business intelligence business (wow - a bit meta that) making it easy to get up and running with a nice user interface and some queer command line tools to use for integration. This post is a short list of lessons learned while working on this.<br /><br /><b>Data quality</b> is important. For a system that has been around for a while it is likely that parts of the data is not of the highest quality. This is not visible until someone put it into reports.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.gooddata.com/\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"188\" src=\"http://www.gooddata.com/images/uploads/poweredby2.png\" width=\"320\" /></a>GoodData has good support for developers with nice, open, informative forums and fast support. The <b>tools are not outstanding</b> in any way (as you can see to the left). Errors are most often obscured and hard to decipher. A certain amount of trial and error is necessary to get forward. According to various sources - old school business intelligence tools are typically even harder on developers and may cost a fortune to implement. This amazes me.<br /><br />There are other SaaS players in the business intelligence niche but only some of them has the option to <b>try the solution before buying</b>. GoodData is one of them. Most of them don&#39;t have any useful information about how to go about doing an implementation on their home page. This is a bit strange to me but maybe the typical business intelligence tool buyer is a suit and not a developer? Pro tips for SaaS vendors: offer free trial account and put useful information on your site.<br /><br />Even millions of data rows take a long time to extract.<br /><br />A <b>flat data structure</b> with lots of redundancies is preferred in the business intelligence end of things. Getting a flat data structure out of a bunch of tables from a highly normalized relational database is not fast at all. My worst case scenario had me at about 13 days to get all the data out. I then abandoned the flatness dream. Export times is not that important though since a full data load should only be necessary once.<br /><br />When getting data out of a live system and it involves several hours of processing the <b>data will most likely change</b>. If you are to join it outside the database it may then fail because stuff exported later may reference entries that didn&#39;t exists in the target dataset. The best way to solve this is probably to just take a copy of the entire database and work with that instead.<br /><br /><b>Lookup tables</b> is not what it sounds like. If I - for example - has a flight dataset that got one departure airport and one arrival airport I can not connect this to the same lookup table but have to create a departure airports data set <b>and</b>&nbsp;an arrival airports data set. This is very wrong to me. (This may be a GoodData weirdness.)<br /><br />Anyway. This were scattered thoughts - I have had a good time playing with these things and have as a result more respect for the complexity of BIG DATA.</p>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 205,"revision_id": 205,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "<p><b><span style=\"font-size: large;\">General ideas </span></b><br /><br />I am on the train back to Göteborg from <a href=\"http://highlevelbits-ferentschik.rhcloud.com/sites/default/files/sites/default/files/images\">Emily Bache</a>.

It is important to also hone your skills of working and improving an existing code base.</li></ul><p><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><b>Some&nbsp; thoughts on TDD</b></span><br /><br />The biggest focus during the whole event was on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development\">TDD</a>. I am a strong believer in writing tests and very (very) rarely I commit a functional change without a test, however, I am not religious about whether to write tests first or not. It depends on the situation.<br /><br />It was nice to to some TDD, but some things I saw still got me wondering. We implemented <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life\">Conway&#39;s Game of Life</a> and a quite common approach I&#39;ve seen in the iterations was to implementing the different (arguably quite simple) game rules. Often one single rule was taken, a test for just this single rule was added and then implemented. The implementation was supposed to just pass, often by initially returning hard coded values. Then a new test was added for the second rule and the implementation changed accordingly. Depending on your level of dummy implemenations you now have to revisit again your first test and implementation, and so on ...<br /><br />I am wondering whether this is really the intention of TDD. For me there is too much mocking going on. The rules for the Game of Life are quite simple and in my opinion can be implemented in one go. You can still write the tests up front, but why not write <i>all</i> basic tests for the four rules up front and then implement the logic? Does TDD really mean that you have to break down a problem sentence by sentence? Is it really forbidden to implement &quot;more&quot; than required, knowing that you will need it a few minutes down the track anyways? Part of being/becoming an expert is that you are (compared to a novice) able to manage a bigger scoped problems. Breaking down problems is good, but as with everything a balance has to be found here as well.<br /><br />I also think there is still room and more importantly value in hacking/spiking sessions. Again a balance is needed. For writing production code TDD is a very good method, but it is not so suited for investigating solutions for a problem. A spike to explore the problem space can be helpful and most importantly <b>fun</b>. In one session I was just quickly exploring in ruby on how to actually display the game using <a href=\"http://rmagick.rubyforge.org/\">Rmagick</a> to generate animated gifs. It was heaps of fun and a very welcome break of all the disciplined work in the other iterations.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><b>Misc</b></span><br /><br />Last but not least, a OO thought. Due to my Java background I naturally tackle most problems in an OO way. In one session though I was the co-pilot and we went for a solution (in ruby) without classes and a very compact data structure for the problem using arrays and maps. I found even thinking about the problem was made much harder, since all was so abstract. There is a certain level of self documentation when you just see names (classes) like Cell and Habitat. It helps your brain to tackle the problem. Advanced data structures are good and maybe sometimes required, but it is definitely a good thing, if you can hide this complexity behind simpler interfaces and classes :-)<br /><br />Overall a very productive and enjoyable day.

It is a pity that something that is so near and so good tends to be forgotten again and again. I haven&#39;t been to Stockholm Film Festival since 2005 and that was my first time despite living here my entire life. I then said to myself that I should attend every year. It turned out that annually happens every six years for me. In any case I went to some 11 films and here is some notes to remember them.<br /><br />It started out with me missing The Man from Le Havre by Aki Kaurismäki. Käthe went and said it was perhaps the best movie of the festival. We saw &quot;Mannen utan minne&quot; a couple of years ago an it was a very beautiful and slow film indeed.<br /><br />Miranda Julys The Future was miserable as expected. She creates bizarre but real personas with such ease. Thinking about it - a theme of the films I saw is definitely &quot;unhappy women&quot;.<br /><br />The most touching film in the &quot;unhappy women&quot; genre was Martha Marcy May Marlene by Sean Durkin about a woman that leaves her life in a sect. It is about two very intense weeks after she left when she stays with her only relative, her sister and her sisters husband. The film clearly depicts the kind of damage one may get in a sect. This touched me very much since I have been brought up in a baptist kinda church that is on the border to sectishness (or whatever it is called....). I can really understand how a badly managed view of the world may create the strangest of minds. On the other hand the mindset of a sect, with its distancing from worldly, capitalist things is really refreshing and should be something to think about for us all. The film contrasted this nicely with Marthas sister being sort of living the capitalist way. Not in an extreme way but still....<br /><br />The darkest of the &quot;unhappy women&quot; genre films was the russian Twilight Portrait by Angelina Nikonova. It takes place in suburban Russia where evil police and a lonely woman walks the broken streets. All is just very sad in a troubling real way. It also got the most&nbsp;thorough&nbsp;party mood sinker ever seen.<br /><br />Victorian&nbsp;Britains&nbsp;contribution to the &quot;unhappy women&quot; genre was a &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; version. In this film everyone was unhappy and it rained a lot and there were lots of mud. Still the camera did some awesome things so it was not a waste.<br /><br />The japanese contribution to the &quot;unhappy women&quot; genre was called Guilty of Romance and was about a bored housewife that ventures out and eventually finds herself at the bottom of things. Or just finding herself as the films sometimes says. The ending is interesting to say the least. I liked it a lot.<br /><br />Hysteria generalized the &quot;unhappy woman&quot; theme. Settled in late 19th century England it had lots of messages put into the story about a young doctor that sways between doing the good work and being&nbsp;successful&nbsp;and finally finds himself where one might guess in such a entertaining and high moods film. One of the best.<br /><br />I saw two documentaries. I only managed half of the VERY long Harrison one by Scorsese. I slipped away in the break being a bit too restless to stay for another 1&#39;45. It was a nice film though. The other one was called Knuckle and is a must see for every feminist wannabe. It was about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Travellers\">irish&nbsp;travelers</a>, how different families fight each other for who knows what. The only reasonable persons in the film (except the creator) was women. The men just wanted to fight each other and they passed it on to their sons. Thinking about ridding the planet of males is strongly backed by findings when seeing this nice documentary.<br /><br />All she can was a nice movie bit it NEVER ENDED. It was about a high school youngster wanting to get to college via winning a qualification competition. It is about her struggle and I guess the nice thing about the film is that it didn&#39;t end as expected. There are failures and miseries but in the end it is sort of sorted out &nbsp;- or not.<br /><br />The weirdest film was korean Invasion of Alien Bikini. With lots of action, weird sex and awesome characters it was great entertainment.<br /><br />The last film we saw was Sleeping Beauty about a young student that seems to live a divided life. She works with several things at the same time as studying and communicates a feel of meaninglessness. Then she accepts a job as a sleeping beauty and it is about this experience the film revolves.<br /><br />So - putting the festival to sleep. I am now a bit film fatigued.... we&#39;ll see if there will be another six years until I attend next time. It would be a shame with so many good creations to watch each year.</p>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 207,"revision_id": 207,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "I finally had enough and rooted my HTC Desire.

Not even <i>App 2 SD </i>would help anymore, since many apps would just refuse to be moved. <br /><br />There are plenty of instructions out there on how to do this, so I don\'t want to repeat too much. I basically followed these <a href=\"http://slhck.wordpress.com/2011/01/11/installing-cyanogen-6-1-1-on-the-htc-desire-gsm/\">instructions</a>. There are four simple steps:<br /><ul><li>Make a backup (eg MyBackup)</li><li>Root the phone. For Mac users there is a very simple app <a href=\"http://unrevoked.com/recovery/\">Unrevoked</a>. I had to reset my phone to factory settings before it worked.

One of my customers claim they are doing agile in a clearly waterfallish organization. It is kind of cool that people WANT to be agile these days but it is NOT kind of cool that the meaning of agile has been watered out to mean &#39;good&#39;. Lean to the rescue. To get on the track with the words and principles of lean I spent a couple of days last week at the <a href=\"http://less2011.leanssc.org/\">LESS conference</a> and here is a couple of thoughts emancipating from this experience&nbsp;merged&nbsp;with&nbsp;some&nbsp;own reflections. (Not a conference report......)<br /><br />Lean is more macro than agile - it tries to fix the entire organization. One of the tracks were called &#39;beyond budgeting&#39; and focused on how organizations can abandon their normal way of commanding and controlling in favor of a more fluid way of work. Key case studies: statoil and handelsbanken. (Note to self: ask sister at handelsbanken about how it &#39;feels&#39; a bit down in the organization. Are they really entirely lean. It is not what I have heard...)<br /><br />Lean that is forced upon a company from above is not really lean - it has to be embraced by the people on the floor also. You can not send in a team to leanify an organization.<br /><br />Relative metrics. Absolute numbers is not useful in a fast changing world. It is much better to compare with similar companies.<br /><br />The absence of lean presentations was a bit surprising. I am not a great presenter but I sure would be able to make better slides than most of the speakers here. Please spend some time with <a href=\"http://www.presentationzen.com/\">presentation zen</a>.<br /><br />Whats the deal with the lean A3 obsession?<br /><br />It would have been sweet with more stuff on changing parts of a stale organization from the inside. If you are lost deep inside an old school organization - is there really anything you can do to start the change? I know - live by example and all that but it really doesn&#39;t bring much change about.<br /><br />It is also a cultural change. Just adding a bunch of practices and values won&#39;t change a thing in the short run. Cultural changes to a large system has to be made incrementally and be measured over a long period of time. (Unless the big bang approach is used - then it is essentially a new system replacing the old one - not the same system that has learnt something.)<br /><br />Lean is definitely up and coming and I predict that companies embracing the lean way today will be market leaders in the future. But we will also see lots of lean attempts that will fail. It is not the easiest thing to change feelings and behaviors of people.</p>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 211,"revision_id": 211,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "<p>Ever wanted a simple wiki, which you can edit on- or offline? A wiki which is easy to back up<br />and does versioning. And what&#39;s about some free hosting as well?<br /><br />I am a big proponent of running a personal wiki to capture and organize thoughts. In case you don&#39;t agree, I recommend you read Any Hunt&#39;s &quot;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Thinking-Learning-Refactor-Programmers/dp/1934356050\">Pragmatic Thinking and Learning</a>&quot;.<br /><br />Self I have been running <a href=\"http://info.tiki.org/Tiki+Wiki+CMS+Groupware\">Tiki Wiki</a> for a long time, but it is quite heavy weight, requires a database and constant upgrading. I was always looking for something more lightweight and now I found it - <a href=\"https://github.com/github/gollum\">gollum</a>. A lightweight racks app which works either via a webinterface or by simple text file editing on the file system.<br /><br />Running gollum locally is as easy as:</p>
<pre class=\"code\">
$ gem install gollum
$ gollum</pre>
<p>However, how can I host this without spending any money. One way might be <a href=\"http://www.heroku.com/\">Heroku</a>, but I recently became a fan of RedHat&#39;s <a href=\"https://openshift.redhat.com/app\">OpenShift</a>. The Express version is free and offers a range of different hosting catridges, including a racks one. Let&#39;s see how easy it is to get your wiki hosted on OpenShift.<br /><br />First you need to sign up for an account. Once that is done you install the command line tools for OpenShift Express via:</p>
<pre>
$ gem install rhc
</pre>
<p>Now let&#39;s create a domain and app for your wiki:</p>
<pre class=\"code\">
$ rhc-create-domain -n <your-domain> -l <email>
$ rhc-create-app -a wiki -t rack-1.1 -l <email>
</email></email></your-domain></pre>
<p>Once you ran this commands you should have a local git checkout in the directory wiki and a running application under http://wiki-<your-domain>-rhcloud.com.<br /><br />Next we need to install gollum. Let&#39;s change into the <i>wiki</i> directory. First open <i>.openshift/action_hooks/build</i> and just add the line</your-domain></p>
<pre class=\"code\">
export </pre>
<p>Now commit this change and push the change to origin:</p>
<pre class=\"code\">
git commit -a -m &quot;Adding &#39;export&#39; in order to display environment settings&quot;
git push origin master&nbsp; </pre>
<p>You will see that on top of the usual git commit messages there are several OpenShift things happening.The export command will be run after <a href=\"http://gembundler.com/\">bundler</a> and dump a whole bunch of settings.We will need some to complete the gollum configuration.Next create a Gemfile and add the following:</p>
<pre class=\"code\">
source &#39;http://rubygems.org&#39;

gem &#39;rack&#39;, &#39;1.1.0&#39;
gem &#39;gollum&#39; </pre>
<p>Then open config.ru and change to this (delete the current content):</p>
<pre class=\"code\">
require &quot;rubygems&quot;
Bundler.require(:default)

require &quot;gollum/frontend/app&quot;

use Rack::Auth::Basic, &quot;My wiki - authenticate!&quot; do |username, password|
  [username, password] == [&#39;wiki&#39;, &#39;wiki&#39;]
end

Precious::App.set(:gollum_path, &#39;<full git=\"\" path=\"\" repo=\"\" to=\"\">&#39;)
Precious::App.set(:wiki_options, {})
run Precious::App
</full></pre>
<p>You need to replace <full git=\"\" path=\"\" repo=\"\" to=\"\"> with the actual path you see in the environment dump.<br />Currently it the line you are after looks like this:</full></p>
<pre class=\"code\">
remote: declare -x PWD=&quot;/var/lib/whatever/whatever/git/wiki.git&quot;
</pre>
<p><i>/var/lib/whatever/whatever/git/wiki.git</i> is the part you are after. As you can see I am using Rack::Auth::Basic for basic authentication, but you can plug something elsein if you like.Now lets lock the gems using bundler and also package them:&nbsp;</p>
<pre class=\"code\">
bundle install
bundle package
</pre>
<p>Add everything to the repo, commit and push.<br />Enjoy your wiki,<br />Hardy</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 212,"revision_id": 212,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "Some random thoughts (of which I had a lot on the 42195 m long track)<ul><li>it is a looooong run</li><li>I really got respect for the distance and for people who can run this in a little over 2 hours.

I finally got to attend a <a href=\"http://coderetreat.com/\">code retreat</a>. The first public one held in Stockholm took place last saturday and it was possibly the best event this year. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/peter_lind\">Peter Lind</a> and <a href=\"http://www.valtech.se/\">Valtech</a> hosted the event in their nice office at Kungsholmen and <a href=\"http://emilybache.blogspot.com/\">Emily Bache</a> facilitated. Read more about the event format <a href=\"http://coderetreat.com/facilitation.html\">over here</a>.</p><p>This kind of event is where you have the opportunity to really learn a lot. A room full of passionate and skilled developers wanting to pair up with you just for the sake of learning. All code is thrown away so there is no pressure of delivery and no schedules to meet. The problem - game of life - is deliberately chosen so that it is impossible to solve it with test driven development in 45 minutes. I managed to code in 4 languages during the day. The session with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/msundb\">Mikael Sundberg</a> where we used clojure was probably the one where I was most passive but it was fascinating to grow a solution in a purely functional language. Two ruby sessions, one in Java (my &ldquo;native&rdquo; language) and one in javascript made the day perfect. Pragmatic approaches to testing in the more obscure languages made it possible to get forward *despite* not using a testing framework. To top it off Emily introduced the <a href=\"http://www.cyber-dojo.com/\">cyber dojo</a> for the last session. Instead of pairing with the same person for 45 minutes you work in 3 pairs and switch partner every 5 minutes so you basically work on the same code base for 10 minutes. With communicative developers it turned out to be really fun. The first minute in a new pair was spent communicating the code at hand and then on to coding. Actually we covered a surprising amount of ground on all 3 stations. A great last session of the day. The day ended with a longer retrospective where everyone got the chance to give feedback and share thoughts about the day.</p><p>Takeaways:</p><ul><li>functional needs more studying - clojure, erlang and haskell are my prime candidates</li><li>it is amazing how different persons communicate in different ways. The first 10 minutes in each pair was typically spent getting a feel for the other person and agreeing on an approach.</li><li>I was a bit surprised by the bottom-up approach that some were inclined to take. I thought that a test for each &ldquo;rule&rdquo; in the game of life was pretty low level. I think it is hard to do the right thing when going too deep first. On the other hand zooming in on one part of the problem made it easier to actually accomplish something. The hardest part of the problem is probably counting the number of live neighbors of a cell. Some team just passed this value in to the cell class making it possible to code all the rules in 45 minutes but without having the full game running.</li><li>throwing away code felt really good.</li><li>pair progamming should be done more often.</li><li>infinity is infinite</li></ul><p>In the middle of the night after the event <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/martengustafson\">Mårten Gustafsson</a> tweeted this weird clip where the game of life is coded in ancient <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)\">APL</a>.

I was lucky enough to get an early invite and already did some test driving. To sum up my experience: \"Facebook in a different skin with some nice add-ons\". <br />I was actually surprised how much G+ looks like Facebook. It almost looks too familiar. Is this is an attempt of Google to create familiarity for Facebook users? Or is Google saying that they don\'t have a better idea on how a social network can or should look like?  <br />Once you look a little closer though, you can luckily discover some nice differences to Facebook. One key feature of G+ is that you sort your contacts into circles (the sorting is nicely done via drag and drop) and for each status update(stream) you decide who should be able to see it. So much to Zuckerberg\'s vision that \"circles of trust\" do not matter. According to him there is always only one you, no matter in which environment. I always disliked the idea. <br />Another G+ strong point is that it is very easy to export your data (liberate your data) from the G+ settings page. This addresses another complaint many Facebook users had. It seems Google tries to attack Facebook at its weak-points and improve on the areas many people complain about (which is maybe not too bad). <br />Last but not least, there are hangouts where you can start a video chat with your contacts. This is very nicely implemented, but you need an additional plugin. <br />Ahh yeah, one more thing - instead of \"liking\" something I \"+1\" something. That\'s nonsense to me. I am not sure whether Facebook has a patent on \"like\", but to say: \"I just have +1\'ed something\" seems silly.<br />So where does this all leave me? Personally I won\'t switch from Facebook to G+. I don\'t think that I want and can convince my friends to collectively switch to G+. I am tired of social networks anyways and even my Facebook usage reduced considerably recently. Sorry Google - G+ is definitely better than Google Waves (miles better), but unless you have a strategy to move 500 million users over to G+ I just think it\'s too late. And what about all these companies which only recently invested into Facebook? Surely they won\'t be jumping on the G+ wagon right now. I guess time will tell ...<br /><br /><b>Update</b>: It seems G+ really becomes the centerpiece of all Google apps.

My new language of choice needs to be taken care of. So I decided to join <a href=\"http://nordicruby.org/\">nordic ruby</a> in Gothenburg this year. I heard lots of good things about the first version a year ago so it was not hard to make the case of going.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/froderik/5843788968/\" title=\"Göteborg by freddie boy, on Flickr\"><img alt=\"Göteborg\" height=\"159\" src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5194/5843788968_968b54b8ac_m.jpg\" style=\"float: right; margin: 1em;\" width=\"240\" /></a>The conference is located in Eriksberg an old shipyard area of Gothenburg. The venue is an industrial building remade into a hotel so we are basically living the conference for 2 days.</p><p>The first day started with github founder Tom Preston-Werner that talked about some of the useful practices they use. Readme Driven Development is about doing just enough of specification before you start coding. TomDoc is human readable code comments that is sweeter to the eye than rdoc or yard. Semantic versioning is by no means a new thing. Tom talked about how it enabled them to modularize heavily without getting lost in dependency hell. All in all a nice talk that shows how it is possible to build something useful with a couple of simple and powerful practices. Much of what Tom said might seem obvious and every simple practice is - the challenge is to not add any other complexities.</p><p>Anthony Eden talked about good APIs. &quot;If you are a software developer you are an API designer.&quot; <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/froderik/5844052737/\" title=\"Nordic Ruby 2011 - first day by freddie boy, on Flickr\"><img alt=\"Nordic Ruby 2011 - first day\" height=\"214\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2723/5844052737_a0f8204046_m.jpg\" style=\"float:left; margin:1em;\" width=\"240\" /></a> We should think about all our work in terms of it being an API. He introduced the 5 C&#39;s - consistent, clear, convenient, concise and complete - characterizing a good API. Then some examples. Net::HTTP was trashed to shreds in a funny way. The same task made good was shown with Typheous and a non-API approach with openuri (that extends the standard File class with URL behavior).</p><p>Thorben Schröder made a swift dive into a new set of tools for avoiding code duplication in javascript/ruby applications. Apparently there are several new libraries for interchanging calls between ruby and javascript. Definitley something to look into a bit more.</p><p>Joseph Wilk talked about a concept called the limited red society taking its WIP counterpart and zooming in on the coding process. The point being that the red phase in coding when test fails basically means &quot;work in progress&quot;. He talked about using different metrics to get feedback from your process. Questions like: &quot;how long have I been in red for each coding step?&quot; can help us improve our internal processes. It can also be a useful ground from which to start dialogue in a group of coders. But as always metrics are useful but shouldn&#39;t be seen as a nirvana. They are not the bigger picture but they help us build it.</p><p>Over lunch I had the opportunity to meet up with my cousin that develops software for Volvo car engines. Always interesting to hear about a different kind of development. I also got to ride in a test car!!!!</p><p>After lunch started of with Joshua Wehners talk on diversity. Our industry has always been kind of single minded and the Ruby community may be even worse with its huge majority of young, white males. Check out <a href=\"http://rubyonrails.org/core\">the page for the rails core team</a>. Joshua made a good case to what we would gain with an increased diversity. He backed this up with all kinds of data from different studies. One interesting study shows that lucky persons are more likely to try new things than unlucky ones - meaning that it might not be so much about luck as about a different mind set. Being among the oldest in the room (at 39.....) I may have increased the conference diversity by a little.</p><p>After that there was this really speedy talk about statistics by Randall Thomas. <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/froderik/5844606672/\" title=\"Nordic Ruby 2011 - first day by freddie boy, on Flickr\"><img alt=\"Nordic Ruby 2011 - first day\" height=\"159\" src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5304/5844606672_5155c32f27_m.jpg\" style=\"float:right;margin:1em;\" width=\"240\" /></a> He started with pointing out some problems with the standard approach to statistics. For example when we say that there is a 50/50 chance of getting heads when flipping a coin we assume that this is true over an infinite number of tries. So it is a purely theoretical stance. He went on to describe bayesian nets that are a technique where previous results affect upcoming results and then he showed some really cool thing that is doable with some csv data and a ruby library for bayesian nets.</p><p>The last scheduled talk of the first day was about education by Joe O&#39;Brien. It was about the common frustration that is present at all conferences with brilliant people. What shall we do with the others? How can we improve the overall quality of our business? Some take aways from this session was the difference between a programmer and a developer. Most of us are actually business developers - we don&#39;t need to understand most of the technical details. It is all about getting the right software delivered to our customer.</p><p>Then a round of lightning talks - entertaining as they should be. Dinner party outside next to the river cafe - a bit chilly but a great time!</p><p>Saturdays first speaker was Paul Campbell with a speak entitled In search of &#39;Mé fein&#39;. (me fein = myself) He gave us a swift retrospect on his life described as the days of the week. It was intertwined with links and fun stuff from the week. Some really fun stuff and some thoughts to bring home.</p><p>Elise Huard used movie style slides to her talk about actors - a nice way to parallellize the execution of programs. Sadly there is no native support for this in Ruby and apparently no plans of doing it either. On the other side of the coin it is possible to use scala actors via jruby (and I guess erlang actors via the jvm erlang that is in the making).</p><p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/froderik/5846029445/\" title=\"day 2 of nordic ruby by freddie boy, on Flickr\"><img alt=\"day 2 of nordic ruby\" height=\"159\" src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3289/5846029445_10b8e967ec_m.jpg\" style=\"float:left;margin:1em;\" width=\"240\" /></a>Jakob Mattson - the only local speaker talked about how Ruby is such a static language. You can&#39;t define anything you want in Ruby. Say you want to write javascript in Ruby for example =&gt; not possible. Say you want to change the meaning of . =&gt; not possible. This may or may not be useful. Most programmers would benefit from more restrictions - not less. Using a DSL may be good sometimes but in many cases it is better to stick with a general purpose language like Ruby and just make sure that the code is as readable as possible. Nevertheless - this was a really thought provoking talk and I hop that Jakob gets more than 15 minutes next year.</p><p>Ryan R. Smith of Heroku described some work he did with getting real concurrency into a job queue application. It did not include queue software but &quot;just&quot; nice and simple use of a database. It fit well with my conclusion that we buy lots of software for no reason when there is a nice, simple and scalable solution close at hand. Strange that is should be so hard to stick with simplicity.</p><p>Then some tenderlove from Aaron Patterson about dealing with legacy systems. He showed a number of sweet ways to alter a legacy code base without too much of a risk. And a key conclusion that I actually have done myself: mocking and stubbing and whatnot is not needed when using Ruby. The meta programming capabilities built into the language makes it very easy to build around any problems that you would have to work hard to mock/stub/whatnot in Java. Gave me more inspiration to delve deeper into the inner workings of Ruby. I *get* most of the techniques but I am not skilled to use them wen needed. (And as seldom as possible since the readability of the code probably goes down a bit....)</p><p>I was looking forward to the talk by Chad Fowler and I was not disappointed. His talk was also about legacy but in a positive way. How do we build systems that becomes our legacy - that will outlive us and seen as great software generations from now. He did not give a clear answer to that question but certainly put a nice perspective on things. Software that has survived since the 70s or so are typically smaller pieces like unix tools or the apache web server. A conclusion of this is to build systems from small parts or cells that in themselves can become a great legacy over the years. I don&#39;t know if it is important to be remembered after I die but to be able to make a contribution that is useful would give satisfaction for sure.</p><p>The concerence ended with a ironman talk by Keavy McMinn. She basically went through how she prepared for the ironman and the succeeded over expectations. I like this cross discipline thinking that the ruby community gots lots of. Coding is not only about technical details but also about personal development and we can certainly learn from many other areas about this.</p><p>This was a great conference and I will probably attend again. The opportunity to meet so many great developers is truly something. I was a bit surprised about the lack of technical depth - just a couple of sessions actually had code in them. This probably reflects that the audience at a conference like this already know it all about Ruby. A newcomer to the language would not have much to takeaway in terms of new knowledge about the language itself.</p><p>More information and links about <a href=\"http://nordicruby.org/speakers\">the authors at the conference site</a>.

In a new brand project I am using couch (and nosql) for the first time and I am also diving into the jQuery ocean. It has been a rewarding trip this far with a couple of frustrations that has been solved with the help of the internets. Time to give something back!</div><br /><div>This post is about how to use tinyMce not just as a nice wysiwyg editor but also for inline editing. The case is that you have a piece of markup on a page that you want to easily change without leaving the page. It turns out that it is not that hard for your specific case. A more generic case might be harder but not by much. As long as the thing you are editing is an entity that it stored in its entirety somewhere you should be good to go. (Couch is of course nice for this.)</div><br /><div>I will assume that you have a running rails project and is familiar with the workings of rails. I am using rails 3 but I think most of the code should work with rails 2 as well. A running rails project with this setup can be <a href=\"https://github.com/froderik/inlinetinymce\">found over at github</a>.</div><br /><div>Lets start with adding some gems to our Gemfile:</div><br />
<pre>
source &#39;http://rubygems.org&#39;

gem &#39;rails&#39;
gem &#39;sqlite3&#39;

# user friendly markup
gem &#39;haml&#39;

# wysiwyg editor
gem &#39;tiny_mce&#39;

group :development, :test do
  gem &#39;cucumber-rails&#39;
  gem &#39;capybara&#39;
end
</pre>
<br /><div>Now we are good to go. Now you may wonder what that cucumber thing is and it is included because we love tests a lot. We love them so much that we like to test drive our applications. Right! So lets start with a cucumber feature. To get rails and cucumber to work together run rails generate cucumber:install --capybara . This will add a bunch of folders, scripts and configurations and we can now call cucumber directly in our root folder to run all the features in the features folder. Lets create a feature called inlinerichediting.feature with something like this in it:</div><br />
<pre>
Feature: rich inline editing
  In order to get a comprehensive context
  as a web site editor
  I want to inline edit text on my pages

  Scenario: edit inline
    Given I am on the start page
    When I click on the element with id &quot;fancy_text&quot;
    And I fill in the editor with &quot;A really fancy text&quot;
    And I press &quot;Save&quot; within &quot;.editor
    Then I should see &quot;A really fancy text&quot; within &quot;#fancy_text&quot;
</pre>
<br /><div>If you know Cucumber you know that it is really the 5 last lines that actually does something. Of these we will need to add our own implementation to 2 of them and the other 3 are provided in web_steps.rb that the cucumber installer generated for us. I start with adding the 2 missing steps that cucumber helped me with writing. And of course nothing will work yet since we have added no views or controllers.... Lets do that - the controller is pretty straightforward:</div><br />
<pre>
class ContentController &lt; ApplicationController
  def home
    @text = &quot;Click me to edit the text&quot;
  end
end
</pre>
<br /><div>We will add more to this file later. And the first version of the view is even simpler:</div><br />
<pre>
.content#fancy_text
  = @text
</pre>
<br /><div>A very simple layout/application.haml to go with this could be:</div><br />
<pre>
%html
  %head
    %title
      Inline Tiny MCE example
    = csrf_meta_tag
  %body
    = yield
</pre>
<br /><div>And the first of our 5 cucumber steps now passes. In the second step we want to click on the text to make it editable. Capybara with Selenium as driver has support for Javascript behavior in the browser - this particular way to interact with the browser is not in the DSL however (only &quot;normal&quot; clickable things) so we need to get further down in the Capybara code to implement this step. What we need to do is find the element and then click on it. Like this:</div><br />
<pre>
When /^I click on the element with id &quot;([^&quot;]*)&quot;$/ do |id|
  find_by_id(id).click
end
</pre>
<br /><div>Just a silly line but I can tell you it took me some time to find out how to do it....</div><br /><div>Now the second of our 5 cucumber steps passes but not the next which is both due to the next step not being implemented yet and to that we haven&#39;t actually done anything on click yet. Lets make the text clickable and show a text area on click. Lets introduce jquery.</div><br /><div>jquery is the most used javascript library out there at the moment. It makes it easy to work with the DOM and has a rich ecosystem of all kinds of things. To add it we just download it and store it in out public/javascripts folder and add one line to views/layouts/application.haml :</div><br />
<pre>
= javascript_include_tag &#39;jquery&#39;</pre>
<br /><div>We also need some scripts of our own and we want them in its own script file:</div><br />
<pre>
= javascript_include_tag &#39;application&#39;</pre>
<br /><div>The first thing we want to do is a bit fancy. We want to give the user a feeling of that the content actually is clickable by changing its appearance when hovering over it. To do that we put the following lines into our javascript file:</div><br />
<pre>
// called by jquery when the document has loaded - sets up all de ztuff
$(document).ready(
  function(){
    $(&quot;.content&quot;).hover(
      function(event){
        $(this).addClass(&quot;selectForEditing&quot;);
      },
      function(event){
        $(this).removeClass(&quot;selectForEditing&quot;);
      }
    );
  }
);
</pre>
<br /><div>So what happens here? A bit messy if you are not used to it. Essentially what happens is that when the document is ready - has finished loading - we have defined a function to be executed. In this function we assign listeners to certain events in the DOM model. In this case we want to listen to when the mouse enters the element with id &quot;content&quot; and when it is exiting the element. Whenever this happens we add or remove a CSS class from the element. Without the CSS - nothing happens. Lets add it and since we are doing everything the proper way we want to put it in its own file in the public/stylesheets folder. Lets call it style.css and put the following styling in it:</div><br />
<pre>
#content {
  border:solid;
  border-color:white;
  border-width:1px;
  padding:5px;
}

.selectForEditing {
  border:solid;
  border-color:gray;
  border-width:1px;
}
</pre>
<br /><div>Ok - this is a little hack counting on that our background is white. You can probably do the same thing in some better way. Please tell me in the comments. CSS is not what I know best..... We also need to add CSS files to the header. The line</div><br />
<pre>
= stylesheet_link_tag :all</pre>
<br /><div>will do that for us. And a nice hovering effect is there!</div><br /><div>Our next mission is to replace the text with an editor when clicked. Initially this will be a simple textarea tag and as a later step we will put a tinyMCE editor in there instead. Now we need some more markup! Our home.haml file now looks like this:</div><br />
<pre>
.content#fancy_text
  = @text
= form_tag &#39;/content/save&#39;,           |
      :remote =&gt; true,                |
      :class =&gt; &#39;hidden editor&#39; do    |
  = text_area_tag :text, @text, :class =&gt; &#39;mceEditor&#39;
  = submit_tag &#39;Save&#39;
</pre>
<br /><div>You may be more familiar with the &quot;form_for&quot; tag but in order to avoid the database overhead and model classes for this tiny example I will use the &quot;form_tag&quot; helper instead. The parameters basically says that this is an asynchronous call to /content/save. The CSS &quot;hidden&quot; (set to display:none;) is applied to make this part of the markup invisible until the user clicks the text. The javascript to swap the text element with the form is:</div><br />
<pre>
$(&quot;.content&quot;).click( function(event){
  $(&quot;.content&quot;).hide();
  $(&quot;.editor&quot;).show();
});
</pre>
<br /><div>and it should be placed in the document-ready-function as well. An editor is there but nothing can be submitted yet. Lets wait with that and make it in to a wysiwyg editor first. The rails plugin for TinyMCE comes with a couple of neat things. Firstly - to include it there is the include_tiny_mce_if_needed method to add to views/layouts/application.haml. It includes the TinyMCE files if they are needed - if the controller has stated a need for them. A controller includes TinyMCE with this code somewhere in the controller class:</div><br />
<pre>
uses_tiny_mce :only =&gt; [:home],
  :options =&gt; {
    :width =&gt; &quot;600&quot;,
    :height =&gt; &quot;500&quot;
  }
</pre>
<br /><div>Here it is possible to configure which of the controller actions that really need TinyMCE (or all if you want that). In our case we have only one controller method - so we add that one. The configuration of TinyMCE is also placed here if you want to have different configuration for different controllers. A default configuration can be placed in config/tiny_mce.yml.</div><br /><div>So we have our fancy inline editor. All that is left is to make the tests run and submit our edits and return to the original text only page. So bear with me - there will be a couple of lines more of code before this is over. Firstly - lets try to make that third step in our cucumber suite run. The reason I waited until now is that the implementation of that step is TinyMCE specific. Thats a bit sad because it would be nice to have a generic test for whatever editor there is. Not possible with the way TinyMCE works. (At least not with my skills - please prove me wrong.) After a fair bit of trying and fair bit of internet browsing I found a solution that works although not elegantly. It uses a feature in selenium that makes it possible to run javascript in the browser. Here it is:</div><br />
<pre>
When /^I fill in the editor with &quot;([^&quot;]*)&quot;$/ do |text|
  evaluate_script(&quot;tinyMCE.activeEditor.setContent(&#39;&quot; + text + &quot;&#39;);&quot;) 
end
</pre>
<br /><div>One thing left to make the third cucumber step work. We need to tell capybara to use selenium instead of running headless. In headless mode there is no support for arbitrary browser script running. To do this we add the file features/support/capybara.rb and enter Capybara.default_driver = :selenium and we have a running cucumber step that sets the text of a TinyMCE text area. A side effect is that selenium will start firefox to run the tests with. It will all slow down a bit.... and spork won&#39;t be that helpful either.</div><br /><div>Actually the fourth step where we push the Save button also works but the resulting page contains an error so the final step can&#39;t find the entered text. In order to make this last thing work we will add the controller method that answers the remote call from the form and some javascript that handles updating of the page when the asynchronous call succeeds. Lets start with the controller. The form pointed towards &#39;/content/save&#39; so lets add a save method to the content controller.</div><br />
<pre>
def save
  @text = params[:text]
  # do some database saving here
  render :text =&gt; @text, :content_type =&gt; &#39;application/html&#39;
end
</pre>
<br /><div>And finally we need to run some ajax style scripts to take care of the result and make the page look good after the edit. When using ajax stuff the glue that makes rails agnostic to javascript framework needs to be present. I call the script file rails.js and add it just as the other javascript files above. Inside application.js we need to place some code to deal with the remote call to the server and - perhaps more importantly - the answer. It looks like this:</div><br />
<pre>
// hide the form when submitting - when the ajax calls succeeds
// put the returned data in the text field and show it
$(&quot;.editor&quot;).submit( function(event){
  $(&quot;.editor&quot;).hide();
}).bind(&quot;ajax:success&quot;, function(event,data,status,xhr){
  $(&quot;.content&quot;).html(data);
  $(&quot;.content&quot;).show();
});
</pre>
<br /><div>...and should also be placed in the document-ready-function. The first part hides the editor div when submitting data. The actual susmission is done by normal form post so no need for scripting there. The second part is the callback when the remote call has succeeded. It sets the returned data in the original text field and then shows it.</div><br /><div>Well - thats about it. I hope you enjoyed it!

We gladly give away our data to companies like facebook, google and twitter without having any real control over it at all. This is a bit contrary to early internet standards email being the most notable where data is distributed and I decide for myself which server I trust with my data. Michiel argued that data and applications should be kept separately with data stored on an unhosted server. Unhosted is building support for this making it possible to write applications that store data in a place decided by the user. A future nicety with this is of course that several applications could work on the same data. While this is a really cool idea it is not something that the normal consumer asks for and it will thus take some time before it becomes the new web standard. What is the killer application for this?

Well, until a couple of days ago, where I got strange error messages from my JDBC driver when trying to connect to a specific schema in my database. I still could connect to MySQL using the <i>mysql</i> command line though. I wanted to know more. I needed to find the mysqld configuration and error logs. But where?<br />I haven\'t looked at the MySQL installation for months and I was not sure where macport installed it. I remembered that the MySQL configuration file is called <i>my.cnf</i> or something <i>*.cnf</i>. I tried a quick:<br /><br /><pre style=\"background-color: #eeeeee; border: 1px dashed rgb(153, 153, 153); color: black; font-family: Andale Mono,Lucida Console,Monaco,fixed,monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 14px; overflow: auto; padding: 5px; width: 100%;\"><code>> locate my.cnf<br />> locate *.cnf<br /></code></pre><br />Both commands gave a uge amounts of hits and I was still not sure where to look at. There must be a better way to find out which configuration the database is using and where the data is stored. I started some digging. Turns out if MySQL is still running, you can simplly issue a SQL statement to get most information you need. The key is the <a href=\"http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/show.html\"><i>show</i></a> command. You might already know <i>show databases</i> and <i>show tables</i>, but do you know:<br /><br /><pre style=\"background-color: #eeeeee; border: 1px dashed rgb(153, 153, 153); color: black; font-family: Andale Mono,Lucida Console,Monaco,fixed,monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 14px; overflow: auto; padding: 5px; width: 100%;\"><code>show variables;</code></pre><br />This command will tell you almost all you need to know, amongst others:<br /><br /><pre style=\"background-color: #eeeeee; border: 1px dashed rgb(153, 153, 153); color: black; font-family: Andale Mono,Lucida Console,Monaco,fixed,monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 14px; overflow: auto; padding: 5px; width: 100%;\"><code>log_error  /opt/local/var/db/mysql5/Sarmakand.local.err<br />pid_file   /opt/local/var/db/mysql5/Sarmakand.local.pid<br />datadir    /opt/local/var/db/mysql5/<br /></code></pre><br />Now I was almost there. I had found the data directories and the log file. A quick look in the log revealed something along these lines:<br /><br /><pre style=\"background-color: #eeeeee; border: 1px dashed rgb(153, 153, 153); color: black; font-family: Andale Mono,Lucida Console,Monaco,fixed,monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 14px; overflow: auto; padding: 5px; width: 100%;\">InnoDB: Cannot find table foo from the internal data dictionary<br />InnoDB: of InnoDB though the .frm file for the table exists.

What if the database would not have been running?

I am very happy about this buy. Much happier than with my HTC Desire. Obviously they are different gadgets, but contrary to my phone where I had to give up battery life and calling comfort in exchange for apps, the iPad only opened up new possibilities. Some daily tasks like emailing or news reading are a real pleasure on the iPad.  <br /><br />One thing I hate though is that I don\'t have access to the file system. Some of you (including Neal Ford in his <a href=\"http://www.jfokus.se/jfokus11/preso/jf11_AbstractionDistractions.pdf\">Abstraction Distraction talk</a>) will tell me that file systems are so yesterday. However, I beg to differ. I think file systems are a perfect abstraction. They are like the drawers in my house. I just know in which one to look. Besides, with access to a file system the problem of disappearing space described in this <a href=\"http://brucefwebster.com/2011/02/28/curious-ipad-behavior/\">blog</a> would be much easier to track. As long as we are building on top of operating systems with file systems, power users want to have access to it and be it via a custom app.<br /><br />Related to this, I hate that I don\'t have full control on how and what to sync from and to my iPad. For some reason iTunes, iPhoto & Co think they know better than I where to place things. This sucks!<br /><br />Anyways, this was not supposed to become a rant about the iPad.

Their India Pale Ale or Göteborgsporter are real palate pleasers. Having a beer this good made here in Göteborg gives me back some hope into Swedish beer. Generally Sweden is rather challenged Sweden in the art of making beer. It should be enough to mention Pripps Blå or Norrlands Guld and if you had to drink any of these beers before you know what I am talking about. The only Swedish hope lies really in a handful of excellent micro breweries, including Oceanbryggeriet. At this point I just have to mention my favorite beer of all times. The German <a href=\"http://rothaus.de/\">Tannenzäpfle</a> from Rothaus. Unfortunately Rothaus is hardly exporting and my consumptions is limited to visits in Germany (maybe a good thing after all).

Starting the day with a mezzo and sandwich (from da Matteo&#39;s own Panetteria) at <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Viktoriapassagen,+G%C3%B6teborg,+V%C3%A4stra+G%C3%B6talands+L%C3%A4n,+Sweden&amp;aq=&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=94.274989,227.636719&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;geocode=FTR9cAMduJO2AA&amp;split=0&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Viktoriapassagen,+G%C3%B6teborg,+V%C3%A4stra+G%C3%B6talands+L%C3%A4n,+Sweden&amp;ll=57.703723,11.965088&amp;spn=0.004288,0.013894&amp;z=17&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=57.703731,11.965361&amp;panoid=fwtxF1fW7GIZrAduEfyLRQ&amp;cbp=12,168.48,,0,3.4\">Victoriapassagen</a> is truely a great start into the day. Once you are used to this coffee there is also no alternative to buying it for home consumption as well. Nothing else will do.<br />Right next to the Da Matteo cafe is another&nbsp; Göteborg gem - <a href=\"http://www.flickornakanold.com/\">Flickorna Kanold</a>. There you can get the best pralines you can imagine. My absolute favourite are the <i>Göteborg Parlines</i> with a dash of sea salt on top. But you won&#39;t be disappointed sampling yourself through the rest of the large handmade parline selection.<br />Talking about paralines one naturally thinks of chocolate. And when it comes to chocolate bars there is another small company I need to mention - <a href=\"http://www.askinosie.com/\">Askinosie chocolate</a>. Even though this is not a Swedish product (far from it, it&#39;s from <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Springfield,+Missouri,+United+States&amp;aq=0&amp;sll=57.696994,11.9865&amp;sspn=1.097919,3.556824&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Springfield,+Greene,+Missouri&amp;ll=37.230328,-93.251953&amp;spn=51.492908,113.818359&amp;z=4\">Springfield Missouri</a>), the whole history behind Shawn Askinosie (the chocolate maker) is so amazing that it is reason enough to mention it here. If you don&#39;t believe me watch this short video where <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKDp49OxqwA\">Shawn</a> tells about his journey from attorney to chocolate maker. Don&#39;t forget to order a couple of bars from the shop. Once you tasted it you will know what truely good chocolate is.&nbsp; And don&#39;t just take my word for it. Check out this <a href=\"http://www.c-spot.com/chocolate-census/daily-review/?pid=1325\">raving review</a> of one of the latest Askinosie chocolate bars.<br />I hope I made your mouth water by now. If you also think that we need more of these enthusisatic food entrepreneurs you should consider becoming a <a href=\"http://slowfood.com/\">slow food</a> member. By becoming a member you support a movement to fair priced, sustainable GOOD TASTING food (if you are interested you can start with this <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECzTRG7tjV0\">video</a> of Carlo Petrini and go from there). On top of these you will have the oppertunity to join some of your local slow food events brining you even more sensational taste-bud experiences.<br /><br />Smaklig måltid from Göteborg,<br />Hardy<br /><br />&nbsp;P.S.

Great venue, great organisation, good speakers, but no big THIS IS AWESOME moment (btw, I found the food was better than yesterday and I liked the fact that the water was from refillable water bottles instead of throw away plastic bottles. Intentionally or not, this was great :-)).<br /><br />Getting into the actual presentations, this second day of JFokus was for me centered around <a href=\"http://www.jboss.org/\">JBoss</a> projects. First I listened to <i>The future of Java enterprise testing</i> (Aslak Knutsen) and then <i>Extensible Java EE</i> (Dan Allen). The projects introduced there were <a href=\"http://www.jboss.org/arquillian\">Arqullian</a> and <a href=\"http://seamframework.org/Weld\">CDI</a>. Both technologies any halfway serious Java EE developer should be aware of, because they are the future of Java EE developement. Arquillian covers the Java EE testing side (<a href=\"http://community.jboss.org/wiki/ShrinkWrap\">Shrinkwrap</a> should be mentioned here as well) whereas CDI is  used on the production code side. Key responsibilties for CDI in short: manage lifecycle, inject dependencies and binding beans to context.<br />I really liked Dan\'s slides and presentation style. They reminded me of a lot of Garr Reynolds and his <a href=\"http://www.presentationzen.com/\">Presentation Zen</a>. This is the way to go. The code examples were at times a little to verbose and lengthy for my taste, but how do you make a technical presentation engaging (presentation zen style) if you also want to show actual code? I think we are missing some essential tooling here :-)<br /><br />I was thinking about this \"how to present\" problem a lot when listening to Neal Ford\'s keynote at the end of the conference. For sure Neal is an awesome presenter and he is funny and engaging, but in the end his presentations are also about story telling. His presentations are more about experiences in the realm of IT than presenting frameworks and explaining technologies. I believe it is much better understood what makes a good story teller compared to a good framework presenter. The latter has a whole set of additional challenges.<br /><br />While I am on it, I should also mention Jeff Genender who had an awesome talk about <i>Everything you wanted to know about Open source that nobody told you</i>. Jeff\'s story about how to get involved into Open Source reminded me a lot of how I got involved myself (fyi, by contributing some patches!) and he also reminded me on what it takes to be good citizen in the Open Source community and what is important in becoming and staying a successfull Open Source project. I also liked the suggestion to  run comapany internal projects Open Source style. This is definitely a challange for many organisations, but I am sure companies which fully embrace this idea will reap the benefits almost immediately.<br /><br />This is almost it, except that I would also like to mention Staffan Nöteberg\'s quicky presentations about regular expressions. It was not so much about the content though. Personally I cannot believe that there are developers out there who haven\'t heard or in fact used regular expressions, but it seems I am wrong on this one. Anyways, what I really like about Staffan is his unique style of presenting. I think there is a lot to learn here and I would love to see more presentations in his style. Staffan uses a lot of storries and metaphors to explain things, gets really involved with a lot of body language and he uses small live coding examples. Well done.<br /><br />That\'s it from me from JFokus 2011. Hopefully until next year. Maybe then with some really new topics. Personally I find that Scala, Ruby, git, etc are great languages and tools, but you really only want to hear so many times how great this technologies are.<br /><br />--Hardy","body_summary": null,"body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 226,"revision_id": 226,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "<p>Picking up on Fredrik&#39;s excellent write ups of JFokus (<a href=\"http://www.highlevelbits.com/2010/01/jfokus-2010-day-1-summary.html\">JFokus 2010</a>, <a href=\"http://www.highlevelbits.com/2009/01/jfokus-summary.html\">JFokus 2009</a>) here comes my subjective impressions of the first day of <a href=\"http://www.jfokus.se/jfokus\">JFokus 2011</a>. Upfront, there is a reason that JFokus grows year by year.&nbsp; It is a great conference and the makers really try to improve with each not JFokus version.<br /><br />For the lazy readers, let&#39;s start with a simple 5 star grading system for some of the key aspects of the conference before diving into details:<br />&nbsp;</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Venue</td><td>*****</td></tr><tr><td>Organisation</td><td>*****</td></tr><tr><td>Food</td><td>***</td></tr><tr><td>Speakers</td><td>****</td></tr><tr><td>Overall</td><td>****</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><p>With this out of the way let&#39;s actually dive into details.<br />First of all congratulations to the venue. The <a href=\"http://www.stockholmwaterfront.com/\">Stockholm Waterfront</a> is really a great venue for a conference like JFokus.<br /><br />Regarding the general organisation one also can only show respect. Given the amount of people and the fact that this is the first JFokus in this venue, one can only say that the whole JFokus team is doning a great job. Thanks!<br /><br />As you might now from previous blog post, food is a very important factor for me (generally and at a conference). Personally I found the lunch quite boreing and I really didn&#39;t like the fact that I get a plate, fork and knive, but nowhere to sit. I know this is quite a logistic problem for 1200 people, but I still believe there are better solutions, eg finger food. The food in the evening was for example much better and it was easy to eat.&nbsp; Fika was also not so great and just black and hot does not make a good coffee ( btw I definitely don&#39;t expect latte art here). Call me a snob, but I think there is room for improvement.<br /><br />But let&#39;s dive into the most important part, the presenters and their presentations, because really it is the combination of these two which make an outstanding talk. As summary,&nbsp; all presentations I&#39;ve seen were good. No really bad presentation or presenter. On the other hand, I also had no AWESOME moment either (maybe tomorrow!?)<br /><br />Regarding the keynote <i>What a crazy year it has been</i> by Henrik Ståhl. It was a fair summary of what happened to Java during its first year under the shepardship of Oracle. Henrik acknowledged some of the mistakes Oracle has made and tried to give his interpretations of things. Unfortunately, some of the really interesting questions missed depth and I got the feeling that Henrik tried to put a lot of problems on our-days business politics. If this is really the underlying problem we are really living in a sad world. I really wouldn&#39;t like to have Henrik&#39;s jobs sitting between the chairs with Oracle the employer on one side and the Java community on the other. Good Luck, Henrik!<br />Overall Henrik&#39;s presentations was ok, but without much new information. A decent presentation performance. I am not convinced though whether it really had keynote potential. Btw, get this guy a Mac, he really wants one ;-)<br /><br />Next up on my schedule was Eric Evans and <i>Folding Togehter DDD &amp; Agile</i>. I really liked Eric&#39;s ideas and they reflect a lot of what I think about DDD and Agile. For me the key idea was that there was a point before Agile where all design was done upfront. This was wrong and partly triggered the Agile movement. Unfortunately, using Agile to the extreme can let the pendulum swing all the way to the other side where in the name of agility <i>no</i> design is done and you end up with hard to change software very quickly.&nbsp; Eric&#39;s recommodations are to use concrete reference scenarios (DDD does not always have to be UML diagrams) to anchor abstract domain knowledge.&nbsp; He also recommends an approach were you regularily go through design and prototype cycles (they can be very short) in order to stay on track and detect misconceptions in the design. For this purpose he introduces his Model Exploration Whirlpool.<br />Overall a good presentation and I think Eric made some very valuable observations. Personally I found his presentation style too calm. He hardly showed any emotion and/or enthusiasm. This is, however, needed to make a presentation really memorable.<br /><br />Speaking about enthusiam. The price for the best presentation of the day goes for me to Emil Eifrem and his <i>Overview of NOSQL </i>talk, mainly because he showed this enthusiam I was missing in Eric&#39;s presentation, paired with great domain knowledge. Emil gave a great categorisation of the NoSQL space (Key-Value Stores, Graph DBs, Big Table, Document DBs) and he also explained the trends which made these technologies relevant (data size, conectedness, semistructure and achitecture). He finished his talk with a look into the future where he sees polygot persistence. Great talk!<br /><br />Heinz Kabutz was next. I am a big fan of his <a href=\"http://www.javaspecialists.eu/archive/archive.jsp\">Java Specialist newsletter</a> and was looking forward to hear his presentation. The content of his presentation was not new for followers of his newsletter. Basically he was iterating over the 10 laws of concurrency which all can be found in the newsletters archive. From a presentation point of view I was not disappointed. Heinz is a really good presenter. The talk itself also offered probably the most valuable information of the day, but somehow the presentation style felt a little canned (maybe the slides could need some touch up as well). Nevertheless, great presentation.<br /><br />Last but not least, there was Nick Sieger with his <i>JRuby + Rails</i> talk. I felt again some special connection shining through, but really did not get fully engaged. This might have been due to the fact that it was so late in the day. The first part of the presentation was the standard Ruby/Rails fair I&#39;ve heard many times. Luckily later on things turned around a little and I made some notes about tools and things I want to check out at some stage, eg <i>bundle</i> or <i>warbler</i>. Cool stuff.<br /><br />A successful day.

It has now grown out of the central cinema into the <a href=\"http://www.stockholmwaterfront.com/\">new waterfront conference</a> centre close to the railway station. The schedule is heavy on scala and domain driven design neither of which is of much interest to me. But it doesn&#39;t matter. Although I will certainly learn a lot my main purpose with jfokus is to meet with lots of old friends from gigs over the years.

Luckily Powers is not an all or nothing type of guy who recommends leaving it all behind in order to retire in a hut in the forest. He sees the advantages of our new connected lives, but also pleads for more person-to-person interaction. It is interesting to read how he finds insights from seven unlikely philosophers - Plato, Seneca, Gutenberg, Shakespeare, Franklin, Thoreau, and McLuhan.<br />Last but not least, Powers suggests something very concrete, an Internet Sabbath. The idea is being disconnected over the whole weekend (by physically plugging yourself out).  Given that I write this on a Sunday you can see that I am not quite there yet ;-) However, I managed to reduce my connected time a lot, especially the time I spent connected via my smart phone. I have an HTC Desire which <a href=\"http://www.highlevelbits.com/2010/10/htc-desire-random-reboots.html\">broke down</a> only after three months. It took four weeks to get a new phone which made me initially upset. Now I see that this helped me to wean myself from my smart phone addiction, where I was spending ways too much time on Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, etc. <br />After the 4 weeks detox I managed to not fall back into old habits and that feels good. Now I can laugh about my obsession to log each of my steps on <a href=\"http://foursquare.com/\">Foursquare</a> just to earn a mayorship. But the reward centers of our brain work in miraculous ways. Listen to <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/tom_chatfield_7_ways_games_reward_the_brain.html\">Tom Chatfield\'s TED talk</a> if you want to know more. <br />Another thing happened during my 4 weeks detox. Before my phone phone broke down, I started to bring more oder into my live by experimenting with various organization and note taking tools. Nothing felt really right though and typing longer texts remains a tedious job on a smart phone. So I switched to a good old paper notebook - a <a href=\"http://www.moleskine.com/\">moleskine</a> (also party inspired by Powers). Paper offers a much richer experience and it doesn\'t blush. I can not only write, but also add drawings and scribbles. I can go forward and backwards and once a certain idea reaches maturity I can transcribe it into electronic form.<br />During my work, I am also trying to walk away more often from my screen when trying to solve a programmatic problem. Sitting infront of your computer screen is the worst possible environment for problem solving. To solve the really hard problems you need off screen time. Listen for example to <a href=\"http://blip.tv/file/4457042?file_type=flv\">Rich Hickey\'s keynote</a> from the recent Clojure Conj.<br />The new year is approaching fast. Maybe some more people should think about a 2011 with less screen time.

He went through the close future of Java and actually presented yet another schedule for version 7. This version that has been in the coming for so long will actually be split into to 2 and a smaller 7 will be shipped mid 2011. Some new stuff will be included which in my opinion only make the language look even worse. Generics and annotations were ugly moves but this new closure thing is even uglier. Better code in a language that supports it properly. Nice news on the other hand is the new property keyword to denote classic java bean properties. And the new stuff about modules looks good too. Kinda take some good parts from maven and put them in the standard. (The way Java has been driven all along - open source initiatives do good needed stuff which are complexified and put in the standard after a couple of years.)</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>I then went for a while to a rather good talk about the web but left halfway cause it was lacking new information for me.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Hardy has been talking about this guy that lives in Chania on Crete and makes a living out of a <a href=\"http://www.javaspecialists.eu/\">newsletter</a> and consulting in the Java world. His name is Heinz Kabutz and he talked about reflection. He showed all kinds of crazy things that is possible to do with reflection - one scarier than the other.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Then a short sales talk by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/matthewmccull\">Matthew McCulloug</a>h about git that was really nice. Didn&#39;t know about bisect and grep before so that was nice news. And that you can pull and push offline is pretty awesome too.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Sandwiches were hard to find half an hour into lunch but I finally got hold of an ok ham sandwich. The coffee was out though....</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>After lunch I decided to find out what the next big JVM language is. <a href=\"http://jroller.com/scolebourne/\">Stephen Colebourne</a> made a great job of listing a bunch of essential criteria to look for in the next language and then went on to disqualify clojure, groovy, scala and fantom. He was a bit for the 2 latter ones mostly because they are statically typed. Statically typed rules because it forces compilation upon lousy developers of which there are many. I tend to agree with this. Developers without unit testing abilities should use statically typed languages. Well then - if neither of these 4 languages don&#39;t cut it.... a new version of Java without backwards compatibility could be the answer. Stephen went on to argue that if ORACLE could increase the productivity of their 10000 developers with 5 % they would indeed make even bigger piles of money.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Then a rather technical talk about <a href=\"http://cassandra.apache.org/\">Cassandra</a> by <a href=\"http://spyced.blogspot.com/\">Jonathan Ellis</a>. A bit over my head really. It is a bit symptomatic that NoSQL talks typically is about how the database has been optimized for scalability. This is probably because there is nothing else to say...</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><a href=\"http://www.scala-lang.org/\">Scala</a> after that. First a fun session with <a href=\"http://dickwallsblog.blogspot.com/\">Dick Wall</a> and <a href=\"http://www.artima.com/weblogs/index.jsp?blogger=bv\">Bill Venners</a> about what is new in 2.8 and then a session on parallellism by <a href=\"http://lamp.epfl.ch/~odersky/\">Odersky</a> himself. Both good. It is a bit interesting to notice that all Scala presentation I have been too this far (5 I think) have all put emphasize on scala advocacy regardless of their subject. Look how bad it is in Java and how sweet it is in Scala kinda. There are lots of really cool stuff in Scala and it is getting better for every new version. What I don&#39;t like is that there are both good and bad ways to do stuff. But I definitly have to learn it a bit more before judging.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Then beers! Had a really fun evening with Rickard, Sofia and Petter at <a href=\"http://www.garshol.priv.no/blog/102.html\">Kulminator</a> a bit south of the city centre. <a href=\"http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/la-trappe-quadrupel-eikenvat-gelagerd/112902/104072/\">La Trappe Quercus</a> was probably the best beer I have ever had.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Thursday morning was not the most alert I had had so I slept a bit longer and then made some final preparations for my own talk before walking another way through the docklands to the venue. So I missed the J2EE keynote - not particularly sorry about that. The first session I went to was right before my own and was about OpenJDK. Dalibor Topic made a good job of describing the work being done and what it would take to be a contributor. Would kinda cool wouldn&#39;t it.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>My own talk on continuous integration went ok. It is always a bit awkward to speak in english for me but I did okey most of the time. I think my message was clear and I also managed to stay within the 15 minutes without problem. Will I submit talks to next year as well? Maybe. Probably about something more technical.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>After that I was really tired and dozed through Monster Builds and How to Tame Them by <a href=\"http://blogs.atlassian.com/developer/cmountford/\">Chris Mountford</a> from Atlassian (sponsor of beer!). He sort of continued with what I had talked about and delved into it more deeply. It was a good and inspiring talk.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>I didn&#39;t expect much from my first encounter with the <a href=\"http://www.javaposse.com/\">Java Posse</a> so I was not disappointed. It was a fun session with key bits of information delivered in a collaborative and entertaining way.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Todays top speak was surely <a href=\"http://www.nealford.com/\">Neal Fords</a> talk about emerging design. .....</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The day was rounded off with a bunch of Java puzzles delivered by Joshua Bloch and William Pugh. This was a number of Java code bits with strange behavior. It was a fun session that unfortunatly missed the punch line. Lessons learned was strangely enough not about how unit testing might have detected these strangenesses. Nevertheless fun and interesting. The mess of the implementation of generics was clearly revealed once again.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The final day started with a round table discussion with several java dignitaries. A mostly fun and somewhat interesting session although I dozed off for a while. When writing the last words of this post I am listening to a session about Apache Camel. After this it is time for some serious sightseeing.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The venue is really suitable for this kind of conference. It gets crowded when 3000 nerds switch rooms at the same time but it has been working fine. The food has been ordinary but that&#39;s to be expected at this big a venue. Antwerpen is a fascinating city with a brutal blend of old and new. And of course the beer is really something.</div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img height=\"500\" src=\"http://c0013548.cdn1.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/x2_36d1a42\" width=\"500\" /></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</div>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 231,"revision_id": 231,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "<p>This is a short text about continuous integration. It serves as a companion to a lightning talk I do on the subject. In this text I will first try to define it, then move on to a short discussion and finally end with some encouragement and perhaps call to action.</p><p>When <b>defining</b> the concept &quot;continuous integration&quot; it is easy to use a bit too many words. I started to think along the lines of &quot;to verify as much as possible as often as possible&quot; but it was a little bit too noisy. After several iterations I decided on the dense:</p><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>verify often</b></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">It is small enough to not be a formal definition. Formal definitions are often a bit far away from the real thing. This short form can also be remembered easily. So continuous integration is for this article defined as &quot;verify often&quot;. Lets have a look at what we can <b>verify</b>. What first springs to mind is to check that the code base is fine. With a static language the first thing to do is to compile the code so that syntactic errors are found. After that unit tests can be run to verify the semantics of the code. With a dynamic language the syntax is verified implicitly with the unit tests. They will simply not run if there are syntactic errors in the code. With this in place we move on to automatic installation of the system in an environment that resembles the target environment and then perform integration and system tests. (And whatever you call your different test levels in your organization.) Almost all kinds of tests are possibly to automate. The exception of course is the visual look and feel of a graphic interface.</div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">With testing in place and a sense of security that most bugs would be detected in any of the different test suites we can move on to automated deployment. For several kinds of systems it is possible to <b>continuously deploy</b> into production. For other kinds it is not possible at all.</div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">So how <b>often</b> is it possible to verify at all these levels? It would be great to do it all on commit and it is indeed possible for smaller systems. The sooner word gets back to the developer that something is wrong the better. It will be fresh in his/her mind and it is often easily fixed. Bugs that are detected after several weeks or even months are much harder to track down and correct. Examples on how different verifiables have different rythm are depicted in the following diagram.</div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/froderik/5171062041/\" title=\"verify meets often by freddie boy, on Flickr\"><img alt=\"verify meets often\" height=\"297\" src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4111/5171062041_8d968a6f0f.jpg\" width=\"500\" /></a></div><div>Keep in mind that this is just an example. As said earlier it is good to push as much verification as possible as close to the code creation as possible. To let this be a design force is actually good for a systems architecture in the long run. You will end up with loosely coupled system parts.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>There are several common objections to continuous integration. The common ones are either about expense or hard-to-test systems. This is definitely valid objections to make but I am sure that you have heard about them before so let me give the <b>discussion</b> part another twist instead. I have played around with a couple of graphs to illustrate the benefits of continuous integration. The first one shows how a developer typically views his work:</div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/froderik/5171061415/\" title=\"developer view progress by freddie boy, on Flickr\"><img alt=\"developer view progress\" height=\"346\" src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4124/5171061415_78dec2a773.jpg\" width=\"500\" /></a></div><div>Work starts with the code, functionality increases over time and finally a release is made. This is - of course - almost never true but many a developer probably have this view nevertheless and finds ways to blame the surrounding for any shortcomings. Maybe other developers were not that good. Or the specs were incorrect. It is always easy to project the blame somewhere else when working in a complex software project.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Consider the following graph instead. It is the view product owners and managers get for a typical software project.</div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/froderik/5171061659/\" title=\"percieved progress from outside by freddie boy, on Flickr\"><img alt=\"percieved progress from outside\" height=\"384\" src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4131/5171061659_b592ddd8de.jpg\" width=\"500\" /></a></div><div>As you can see the software is only transparent at iteration ends. This is when something is released for testing. The armada of test personnel - that typically spend most of their days planning (tremendous waste of resources that) - now gets the chance to test and - if lucky - the project is on track and the next iteration commences. In worse cases the software coming out of the first iteration is completely useless and the project is late from the beginning.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Apparently there is a big gap between developers view of the world and manager type peoples corresponding view. The good news is that the power is with the developers. If they want to they can make sure that continuous integration happens and that managers get good insight into the actual progress. (Managers typically don&#39;t understand that continuous integration actually are a very good thing for them.) And make the world look a bit more like this.</div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/froderik/5171663126/\" title=\"percieved and actual progress by freddie boy, on Flickr\"><img alt=\"percieved and actual progress\" height=\"354\" src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4132/5171663126_a83b03f287.jpg\" width=\"500\" /></a></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">Nirvana - with continuous integration the actual and the perceived progress is the same. It is a good situation for everyone involved. And the good news again is that developers are needed to make it happen. Automation is basically what developers do all the time and continuous integration is just another kind of automation.</div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">Finally a moment of <b>encouragement</b> with nice pics and all. In many settings the task of setting up a nice continuous&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/jarkkos/423296318/\" style=\"float:right; padding: 1em;\" title=\"Busy at work by JarkkoS, on Flickr\"><img alt=\"Busy at work\" height=\"240\" src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/155/423296318_37495d54d7_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" /></a>integration environment may seem like an impossible task. It may actually be the case that it is not possible to get a centralized place for automation in some organizations. I sure have worked at such places myself. This is not however an excuse to do nothing at all. There are always something that can be done. With a bit of cron and a bit of shell script you can have your own hand made continuous integration server. Set up a bit of compiling or a bit of automated system environment installing. Let it sink in and get acceptance - then move on and automate something else. Set up a hudson instance on your own machine and show it to your peers. They might shrug their shoulders but at least you tried.</div><p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/whsimages/1877849503/\" style=\"float:left; padding:1em;\" title=\"Band in the Country by Wisconsin Historical Images, on Flickr\"><img alt=\"Band in the Country\" height=\"187\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2070/1877849503_4870764100_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" /></a></p><br /><div style=\"text-align: left;\">Sometimes it feels that we work in organizations from the 19th century. The thinking and the doing has stayed along from a distant time. Stuff are being done and not done because of tradition rather than for good reasons. This is not an excuse to not be awesome. Your own work could always be of the highest quality regardless of what low and strange expectations there is in the organizations. Unit testing can be a part of your way to develop even if there is &quot;no way unit tests gets into the version control system&quot;. Just do it anyway. Eventually someone will notice that your code comes with quality compared to others and that it doesn&#39;t slow you down. And sooner or later you will leave the place anyway so better leave it with some great practices in place.</div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">Finally some words about our managers. Keep in mind who is paying and who is doing the fun work. Let them get a great view on the progress in exchange for paying for your work.

Any IDE can do that, provided your JDK comes bundles with the sources jar file (<i>src.jar</i> on Mac). You can check whether you have the sources for your JDK by checking the <i>/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6/Home</i> directory. If you have the sources installed you should find <i>src.jar</i> there.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the sources are not installed by default (go figure why), instead you have to download and install the Java Developer Package for Mac OS X. This package is available via the <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/\">ADC</a> (Apple Developer Connection). The download is for free, but you will have to register with ADC first. Here is a direct <a href=\"http://connect.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MemberSite.woa/wo/8.1.17.2.1.3.3.1.0.1.1.0.3.8.3.3.1\">link</a> to the Java related downloads. It hopefully works once you are logged in and save you some frustrating searching.<br /><br />The downloaded package is called <i>Java Developer</i> and is in the <i>pgk</i> format. Given my <a href=\"http://www.highlevelbits.com/2009/10/os-x-106-snow-leopard.html\">bad experience</a> with Mac\'s Java related installers, I wanted to just get the <i>src.jar</i> out of <i>JavaDeveloper.pkg</i> file. But how to unpack a pgk file? <a href=\"http://www.timdoug.com/unpkg/\">unpgk</a> to the rescue. Once downloaded and started you simply drag a pgk file into its window and it will unpack everything into the current directory. Just get hold of <i>src.jar</i> and copy it to <i>/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6/Home</i>. Thank you very much :)<br /><br />Why do these type of things have to be so hard? This problem with getting hold of <i>src.jar</i> made me once more aware of how little Apple cares about Java developers. And if I needed any further proof Apple decided now to even <a href=\"http://www.infoq.com/news/2010/10/apple-deprecates-java\">deprecate Java</a>. I think Apple is not realizing that part of Mac\'s popularity is based on mouth to mouth propaganda. For some time nerds (developers) switched to Mac, because it offered something unique. With Mac OS X they got the the power of a Unix-based operating system <b>and</b> a very slick UI. And whom do you ask what new computer to buy? Of course your software developing nerd friend. However, a slick UI will not for ever compensate for more and more restrictions put on these nerds. Together with the absolute ignorant behavior shown in handling hard- and software problems I wonder how long it will take until these nerds will be leaving the Mac again. And what will they recommend their friends then?<br /><br />Anyways, this little Mac rant came for free with the unpgk tip.

I think the name is sort of fabulous and needs further explanation to the world hence this post. System is basically the same word in swedish and english and bolaget means &quot;the company&quot;. So Systembolaget translates roughly to &quot;The systems company&quot;. Systembolaget is a bit long to say so most swedes use the shorter &quot;Systemet&quot; that translates to &quot;the system&quot;. So when we are going to get some beers for a BBQ we just say &quot;I am going to the system to buy beer&quot;. So why is &quot;the system&quot; only used to selling alcohol - it could just as well sell anything systematic. Historic reasons obviously. I will get to that shortly. But first lets just visit our nordic neighbours for a quick check.</p><div>&nbsp;</div><div>All nordic countries except denmark (obviously....) has alcohol monopolies. They all have more honest names than their swedish counterpart. In finland it is the most honest - called Alko - no nonsense there. Norway has Vinmonopolet (the wine monopoly), Iceland got Vínbúðin (wine shop) and Faroe islands has Rúsdrekkasølan. I am not completely sure about what the latter means. Rús is being aroused or drunk and drekka is drink - together something like the swedish word rusdryck thats basically just another word for alcohol but literally means &quot;a drink that gets you drunk&quot;.... Søla probably means shop in faroeish. It is not even a danish word.</div><div><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/morner/637638682/\" style=\"float:right; margin:10px;\" title=\"Smart reklam by morner, on Flickr\"><img alt=\"Smart reklam\" height=\"180\" src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1076/637638682_70d3f34039_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" /></a></div><div>Back to Systembolaget. The idea behind systembolaget is actually quite old. In the mid 19th century, several cities introduced monopolies on alcohol sales starting in the cities of Falun and Jönköping. This was a side effect of the absolutism movement that appeared at the same time as the socialist and baptist movements. Although having different theoretical foundations they all share lots of common behavioral traits. In 1865 the idea was introduced in Gothenburg and was called the &quot;Gothenburg system&quot; and this is thought to be the origin of the name Systembolaget. By the end of the 19th century most cities had their own &quot;systems company&quot; and it was easy to put them all together in one big systems company in 1955. So there we are in 2010 with a alcohol monopol that we love and hate. At least it is open in saturdays now so you don&#39;t need to make your alcohol based weekend plans on friday.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Read more <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systembolaget\">here</a>.</div><div>&nbsp;</div>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 234,"revision_id": 234,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "<p>Time for some more Mac tool recommendations.

Both are from binaryage.<br /><br /><b>Visor </b>is a Quake Style Terminal. I use the Terminal application (shell) a lot. Together with my IDE it is probably the most used application on my Mac. I also utilize my virtual desktops a lot. One feature I always missed on Mac was the ability to configure an app to follow a desktop switch (sticky windows under Linux). The only solution (correct me from wrong) is to open a Terminal on each desktop. That, however, does not work so well with cycling apps using the <i>Command+Tab</i> shortcut. Visor is the solution and not only do I have now my shell available on each desktop, I also get the geeky ahh-factor visor style behavior. Just try it out!

Tonight&#39;s feat was dynamic stockholm 2010 - a mini conference about dynamic languages. It started as early as 16 - a great excuse to leave the client site a bit early. The venue was Kolskjulet at Kastellholmen - a former military building used to store coal but nowadays used as a conference venue. First out was<a href=\"http://highlevelbits-ferentschik.rhcloud.com/sites/default/files/sites/default/files/images\">Mikael Kindborg</a> that now works for mosync with developing their dynamic side of things. He talked about dynamic languages in the mobile setting. After that <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/smalltalk80\">Niklas Björnerstedt</a> held the fluffiest talk of the night about agile releases. Lots of insights there about how to think about releases in an agile setting. Then came my second encounter with Seaside. The first one <a href=\"http://www.highlevelbits.com/2010/04/seaside-next-level-web-development.html\">occurred earlier this year</a> and was held by Göran Krampe (co-organizer of this event). This time <a href=\"http://blog.fitzell.ca/\">Julian Fitzell</a> - one of the creators of the framework talked about it in a great and entertaining way. Then dinner consisting of landgång (english for that anyone? - a kind of sandwich with everything on it but not like a dagobert sandwich....) and chit-chat. After dinner came 4 lightning talks about groovy (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/niklasl\">Niklas Lindström</a>), common lisp (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/hankhero\">Henrik Hjelte</a>), python (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/jonasbeckman\">Jonas Beckman</a>) and smalltalk (Björn Eiderbäck). They approached the task of introducing a language in very different ways which made this part very entertaining. Lots of laughter and some understanding. All the languages have their merits and it probably depends on what you are doing. I missed two languages a lot: erlang and ruby and I hope they will appear in the next version of this conference. Erlang because I want to learn more about it and Ruby because it is my current language of choice - mostly because it is practical in all the places where smalltalk is not.

Before that engineering had been the predominant way of looking at software development efforts. The book with the concept as its title appeared in 2001 and a number of thought leaders in our field has modelled themselves since as software craftsmen. It is a concept that certainly is appealing. But isn&#39;t is just another buzz that will go around for a while? Not sure but to found out more I reacted positively to <a href=\"http://twitter.com/peter_lind\">Peter Linds</a> tweet about going to <a href=\"http://parlezuml.com/softwarecraftsmanship/\">Software Craftsmanship 2010</a> - a conference promising to miss out on keynotes and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Races_and_species_in_The_Hitchhiker\'s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Fluff\">fluff</a> in favour of joint coding and peer-to-peer learning.<br /><br />The conference is 10 sessions in 3 tracks. All sessions must involve elements of audience coding. As a result the number of slides were low and the total minutes of one-way communication put to a minimum. I first went to conference organizer <a href=\"http://twitter.com/jasongorman\">Jason Gormans</a> session on refuctoring. I had already watched his - or rather imaginary enterprisy consultant Keith Bank-Account (actually a fellow of the Institute of Mortgage-driven Software Development) - videos (see below) so I had a fair idea of the concept - take something extraordinarily simple like a &quot;Hello world&quot; program and mess it up thourougly. This was ironically put forward as a great idea to make a customer dependent. It was a truly fun session to get as much dirt as possible into a simple piece of code. Halfway through Jason made us change pairs and introduced a new &quot;requirement&quot; - we were now supposed to make the program say &quot;Hello Fredrik&quot; instead of &quot;Hello world&quot;. This made it painfully clear that it takes only about 20 minutes to mess up a piece of code so thouroughly that it is a real pain to maintain.<br />&nbsp;</p><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><object height=\"344\" width=\"425\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/7RJmoCWx4cE?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" /><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><embed allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"344\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/7RJmoCWx4cE?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\"></embed></object></div><br /><p>Anyways - back at the hotel I made a little implementation that is more nerdy fun than messed:</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div><p>In all the jollyfullness of this session lays a shared sadness - we have all seen code similar to the one we mockingly produced being written by collegues of ours and often with the best of intentions. Going to a conference like this might make me a somewhat better coder but it doesn&#39;t change the fact that the majority of coders produce code that is a mess and that they don&#39;t understand themselves. It&#39;s a kind of magic really.<br /><br />The second session was by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/chrismdp\">Chris Parsons</a><insert here=\"\" name=\"\"><insert company=\"\" here=\"\">. He introduced a piece of really messy Ruby code and a decent test class that passed and made us make it tidier. It was an interesting exercise that clearly showed that any kind of mess is worthy of salvation. A key to clear and clean code is naming. Just with a couple of name changes the code was made much clearer and easier to refactor further. The crappy code is over at <a href=\"http://github.com/chrismdp/checkout-kata\">github</a>.<this github=\"\" repo=\"\"><br /><br />The third session was a short one where Neill Pearman<insert here=\"\" name=\"\"> introduced a couple of koans in cucumber to learn how to mock and stub in Ruby. We didn&#39;t had time to finish the exercise but it will be a great thing to come back to later. The koans is up at <a href=\"http://github.com/njpearman/MyMocker\">github</a><this at=\"\" github=\"\" place=\"\">. A koan is a way to learn a new language or technique step by step with the help of tests. Run the tests - get some feedback, add some code and so on. If it sounds interesting you should check out the <a href=\"http://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans\">koans for learning ruby</a>. (Still on my to do list...)<br /><br />Then finally it was time to build some robots. In this case robots that can play tic-tac-toe. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/mattwynne\">Matt Wynne</a> had built a nice web site with abilitied for uploading and running competition between all entered robots. A robot is defined as a program called move that were to be packaged with its dependencies in a zip file for upload to the server. <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/expo86/2348680488/\" style=\"float:left; margin:10px\" title=\"Tic Tac Toe by lilpixiegirl03, on Flickr\"><img alt=\"Tic Tac Toe\" height=\"180\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2192/2348680488_c72ec359e3_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" /></a> The tournament engine calls move with the current state of the board and expects a move back. In the tic-tac-toe case the state was represented as a nine character string and the move as the number of the square representing the move. I trioed up with two unknown persons where one were a C# programmer. I decided to go for Ruby and my mates were happy with that. We had a great time writing a brute force program that had a rather decent strategic approach to the game and we finally finished 7th in the overall standings for the 5 tournaments that got run. It is a bit interesting that a game with no distinct winner if both parties plays at their best can pose a problem for programmers. And indeed most lost parties seemed to be due to failing programs rather than failing strategies. Did we test drive this? No. One of my team mates wanted to but I talked him out of it arguing that a half hour program can be tested manually at a low cost.<br /><br />Overall it was a great conference. A bit short perhaps but with this kind of activity you don&#39;t have energy for a longer day. If it is about the get longer I would suggest doing it over several days. And as fellow swede <a href=\"http://twitter.com/johannescarlen\">Johannes Carlén</a> insightfully stated in <a href=\"http://blog.callistaenterprise.se/2010/10/08/my-write-up-on-software-craftsmanship-2010/\">his report</a> from the event:</this></insert></this></insert></insert></p><blockquote>One thing though, there are a lot of people travelling around conferences worldwide advocating the software craftsmanship way of being. Where were they this sunny day of hands-on sessions in Bletchley Park?</blockquote><p>Maybe the only hands-on they know about is keynote?<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/draco2008/2246636931/\" style=\"float:left; margin:10px\" title=\"Bletchley Park by Draco2008, on Flickr\"><img alt=\"Bletchley Park\" height=\"180\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2195/2246636931_cc03ea4a13_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" /></a> The venue - Bletchley Park is brilliant for several reasons. It is the cradle of computing and now serves as a museum. It is also a beautiful site with the mansion that may be an architectural monstrosity but nevertheless with its own beauty - the kind that comes with age. The conference administrators ran the thing smoothly and created a nice experience for us all - lots of thanks to Jason and his crew. I will seriously consider returning next year if it fits with my plans. (And possibly also contribute with a session.)<br /><br />This was also an opportunity to stay another day and wander the streets of London - never a bad thing. I was fortunate to visit the same day as norwegian goth metals <a href=\"http://www.tristania.com/\">Tristania</a> - great concert at the Underworld!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 238,"revision_id": 238,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "I started this morning with the intention of writing a quite upset rant about Apple\'s support and hardware replacement policies. Yesterday after returning from a three week vacation I plugged in my MacBook and started to work away. For some reason the trackpad button was not behaving as it should and in the end stopped working. I was for a moment really baffled, but when I turned the notebook around it was obvious that something was wrong. My battery had swollen up as described on <a href=\"http://www.appledefects.com/wiki/index.php?title=Swollen_Battery\">AppleDefects.com</a>.<br /><br />I took my notebook immediately to <a href=\"http://www.macforum.se/\">Macforum Göteborg </a>where I purchased the notebook in 2008. Even though the warranty on the notebook had already ran out, I still expected to get a new battery without fuzz. I can accept that the capacity of the battery over time degrades. Hey, I could have lived with a battery so bad that I pretty much have to be plugged in all the time, but a battery swelling up like this is not acceptable. It shows poor quality parts and/or manufacturing errors, neither anything I expect from a 30000 SEK notebook. Damn, didn\'t I already pay the \"Mac price premium\"?<br /><br />At Macforum I was then surprised when they told me that they have seen this before, but Apple supposedly refused free replacement. They recommended me to <i>just</i> buy a new battery. WTF! For me that was not acceptable and I started to argue the case. It took over an hour and finally Macforum agreed out of - what I understood at the time - <i>\"pure kindness\"</i> to replace my battery. However, the battery had to be ordered and I will hopefully receive it within a week.<br /><br />I went home determined to write about the kindness of <b>my </b>Mac shop and to rant about Apple\'s replacement policies. But when I started to research the issue today, I noticed that actually many people had the same problem, but with very different experiences regarding the replacement of the battery. Some said Apple replaced the faulty batteries without problems others said Apple refused replacement. The same seems to apply to the resellers. I am not sure what to believe at the moment. My only recommendation in this case is to not accept a no from either Apple or the resellers! I will try to get more information from Macforum when I pick up my new battery.

We stayed at Käthes daughter Veronicas house in the little village of Avessada a couple of swedish miles north of Lisbon. Veronica is transforming a piece of barren land around the house into a self sustainable farm. With help of volunteers she has truly accomplished a lot in a very short time. Read more about it <a href=\"http://www.quintadamandragora.com\">here</a>. The village only has some hundred inhabitants but still manages to support 4 bars. This was a good thing since our Internet oriented hosts didn&#39;t have a proper TV cable and I really wanted to see some of the world cup games. (Sadly enough - Portugal didn&#39;t win any games during our stay.) A beer is only 70 cent or so so it is really affordable to go out and have a beer or a coffee. There are two kinds of local beer: Sagres and Superbock. Apparently people lean towards Sagres in the south and Superbock in the north. <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/froderik/4750981669/\" title=\"sagres by freddie boy, on Flickr\"><img alt=\"sagres\" height=\"163\" src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4077/4750981669_a06a8d8f18_m.jpg\" style=\"float: right; margin: 1em;\" width=\"240\" /></a> To me they taste about the same and are really superior to &quot;normal&quot; Swedish beer like Pripps, Spendrups and Norrlands Guld. The coffee is also great and is strong and a bit larger than caffe italiano.</p><br /><p>Food is great in Portugal. It is perhaps not very fancy but the ingredients are so good that everything just tastes great. We cooked some at home and had some nice lunches and dinners out. Meals to remember were the seafood lunch in beach heaven Ericeira, the buffet lunch on a side street in Sintra with home cooked food by 2 friendly ladies, the very cozy restaurant in Tomar where we sat in a nice homely garden, the sushi at Origami just next to Oceanario in Lisbon, the lunch at a local joint in Malveira (down the hill from Avessada) that were just very local and very good (grilled sardines!), the brazilian meat dinner in Lisbon and of course a great midsummer&#39;s dinner at home with our hosts and some of their friends enjoying (?!) snaps and sill!</p><br /><p>We did 2 day trips to Lisbon using public transportation to get there and made it to most of the sights and places. <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/froderik/4751642384/\" title=\"Flying through the sea by freddie boy, on Flickr\"><img alt=\"Flying through the sea\" height=\"180\" src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4102/4751642384_1eb8e8d4d7_m.jpg\" style=\"float: left; margin: 1em;\" width=\"240\" /></a> Even though I have visited Torre de Belem before it was great to do it together with the kids. Just strolling around in the old parts or Lisbon is also a great time. It is vivid streets where people actually live in the old hoods. We visited Oceanario which is a huge place with lots of aquariums filled with all kinds of strange and normal fish. There were also a couple of open spaces with birds from different climate zones. The subway station serving Oceanario is called <a href=\"http://www.golisbon.com/sight-seeing/oriente-station.html\">Oriente</a> and has this truly awesome futuristic architecture. Think Star Trek space ship but more voluminous.</p><br /><p>The weather was a bit interesting. We had some hot days especially in Lisbon and when going inwards from the coast. And we managed to get one great day at the beaches around Ericeira but half way through the coast was about 20 C and misty so we canceled our plans of visiting the bird island outside of Peniche and also didn&#39;t make it to surfing school. But we had no problem filling our days with other things to do. One day we stayed at home and only went for a long walk. First up to the hill top with two big wind power stations. It was a strange feeling to look at the great views with 2 rotors moving about somewhere up there. <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/froderik/4751685708/\" title=\"castelo de almourol by freddie boy, on Flickr\"><img alt=\"castelo de almourol\" height=\"180\" src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4077/4751685708_64dc64c83c_m.jpg\" style=\"float: right; margin: 1em;\" width=\"240\" /></a> Then we walked around the entire hill (the kids gave up after the hill climb though) finding a couple of geocaches on the way.</p><br /><p>2 days were spent in Sintra in the two strange palaces with accompanying gardens from the 19th century. True imagination to come up with all the details in the architecture and a crazy bunch of people to fund it and populate it during the summers. What else? We spent about a day on the templars trail visiting the great Castelo de Almourol in the midst of Rio Tejo and Convento de Christo - the magnificent portuguese templars head quarters on the hills overlooking the nice city of Tomar. All very medieval, terrifying and uplifting.</p><br /><p>The perhaps saddest part of the trip was our visit to Fatima. I really had to see this sacred place to get a feel for it. The place where a couple of kids saw Mary and people started going there en masse despite the church initial attempts to marginalize it. <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/froderik/4751700114/\" title=\"walking on knees is big in fatima by freddie boy, on Flickr\"><img alt=\"walking on knees is big in fatima\" height=\"78\" src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4100/4751700114_e0b8809838_m.jpg\" style=\"float: left; margin: 1em;\" width=\"240\" /></a> It was fascinating to see the big square between the two churches in memory of the event. There is a special lane for people walking on their knees to make God listen better. Being a former newborn it is always depressing to see religion having so much power over people. Maybe it is good for some of them but I am sure that for many it is rather a limiting force.</p><br /><p>And the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/graffiti/\">graffiti</a> was great. <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/froderik/4751097143/\" title=\"Robin Hood sai à noite by freddie boy, on Flickr\"><img alt=\"Robin Hood sai à noite\" height=\"180\" src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4116/4751097143_83c866f2cb_m.jpg\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em;\" width=\"240\" /></a></p><br /><p>As always - a good guide book (Lonely Planet this time) is really useful and we had good luck with restaurants we tried outside the text. Just look for the locals is as good an advice as ever. There are <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/froderik/sets/72157624419393954/\">more pictures over at flickr</a> if you just can&#39;t get enough!

I just want to know what\'s on my SDcard. Personally I would have wished for more structure on the filesystem. It\'s a mess on there :(. Good thing about the latest version is also that it comes with a task manager which allows me to kill any app<br /></li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Quick Settings</span> - a must have! One of the few apps I have as shortcut on the \"desktop\". Easiest way to quickly turn on/off bluethooth, Wi-fi and GPS</li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Gesture Search</span> - nice app. Used it a lot in the beginning when I did not have my most used apps as shortcuts. I mainly use it to find and start applications. Not so much for finding contacts</li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Dropbox</span> - trusty dropbox. A must have on your computer and now on your phone as well. In case you don\'t have a dropbox account yet use this <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTQ1OTQ4OTk\">link</a> and give me and you some extra space<br /></li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">TripIt</span> - again a app I already used on the computer, but became so much more useful now. Traveling really gets easier with this app and it must be one of the apps with the nicest design</li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Remember The Milk</span> - same as for TripIt. Becomes so much more useful on a smart phone. In contrast to TripIt which is stronger as android app than webapp, Remember the Milk on the phone has still some way to go. Nevertheless, I shelled out the money for the pro version </li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Runstar </span>- best running training app I found. Awesome design.

The first talk by Wolfram Kriesing set the tone - the future mobile app is built with HTML. The need for native apps will simply go away. There are some things you can&#39;t do with a webapp that you need to do with a native app. To solve this problem there is <a href=\"http://www.phonegap.com/\" id=\"qw0t\" title=\"Phonegap\">Phonegap</a> that bridges native functionality to the webapp. The mission of phonegap is to finally disappear when these features is part of the HTML spec and implemented in all browsers.

In the meantime we can build one webapp and use phonegap to get it to various devices.<br /><br />Then <a href=\"http://divineprogrammer.blogspot.com/\" id=\"k25d\" title=\"Mikael Kindborg\">Mikael Kindborg</a> talked about dynamic languages on the android platform.

He finished of with showcasing <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/\" id=\"aesu\" title=\"YQL\">YQL</a> - a Yahoo! tool to do joined queries on the server instead of joining them at the client.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.arctictiger.se/\" id=\"n.v9\" title=\"Tom Blackmore\">Tom Blackmore</a> - the gis guy - talked about how to implement geolocation succesfully.

New smart phones combined with new smart HTML enables us to make really smart applications. One app he made shows the heart rate via bluetooth in a mobile web application.

Here is a little speech I gave at my last <a href=\"http://www.toastmasters.se/gtm/\">Göteborg Toastmaster</a> meeting. Why do you not follow me on a trip to<br /><br />MI BUENOS AIRES!<br /><br />It was early in the morning. I woke up after a 13 hour flight. Looking out of the window I finally saw our destination - <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires\">Buenos Aires</a>. It felt like the city never ended. I had never seen such a big city before. Imagine a place with 13 million people! After landing we took a taxi into the city driving on an elevated expressway. To the left and right one tower building next to the other. And then after a 40 minutes, leaving the expressway, we were taking our final step into the city. Buenos Aires had us in its grip. People everywhere, cars honking, buses roaring. It\'s was frightening, but at the same time exciting! Just an example, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenida_9_de_Julio\">Avenida 9 de Julio</a> in the city center is 12 lanes wide. Try crossing this road in one go! <br />But it takes only a few days until you realize that all the things you were initially so terrified about are nothing else then the pulse of this city. You live with it and learn how to flow with it. In the end it even feels strange when on a public holiday the city is just this tiny tad less noisy and frantic.<br /><br />MI BUENOS AIRES la gente - the people!<br /><br />What makes a place really special? It\'s the people you meet. One amazing thing about Buenos Aires is the friendliness of the Porteños - the inhabitants of Buenos Aires. It is so easy to meet people, having just a short conversation. Sometimes this might even end with a dinner invitation. It is hard not to fall in love with this type of openness. And once you get to know people you will also hear about their worries. For example, you will hear, how frustrated and disappointed they are with the government. Politicians as well as great parts the public sector are corrupt, making it hard for the whole country to move forward. Most people will also painfully remember the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_economic_crisis_%281999%E2%80%932002%29\">2001 crisis</a> when Argentina went bankrupt. There was inflation and the accounts of people were frozen. Many people lost all their savings. To the day people don\'t trust banks. Instead their preferred place to keep money is stashed under the mattress. Cash is King.<br /><br />MI BUENOS AIRES los famosos - the celebreties!<br /><br />It\'s time to talk about a few famous people. Remember at least one of these names and you will have a great conversation opener for YOUR trip to Argentina. Lets start with the music. Ahhh, Tango. The love, the passion! If you are only a tiny bit interested in tango you will sooner or later hear of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Gardel\">Carlos Gardel</a> the soul of tango and the one person who made tango fashionable. One of his most famous songs is: \"Mi Buenos Aires Querido\" :)<br />On the political side, there is of course <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Per%C3%B3n\">Juan Perón</a> and his wife <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eva_Per%C3%B3n\">Evita</a>. Both loved and hated at the same time. Perón was a military social climber who became the most famous Argentinian president. His style of politics even has its own name - Peronism. However, his success would not have been possible without his charismatic wife Evita whom all of you probably know from the movie with the same name. But even though she was fighting for the poor and for women rights her legacy is controversial and many people will accuse her of acting in pure selfinterest.<br />Last but not least, the sports. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Maradona\">El Diego</a>, la mano de dios - the hand of god! Who hasn\'t heard of this famous football player with the number 10. Maradona is still treated as national hero in Argentina. He even has a honorary lounge in the famous football stadium la <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estadio_Alberto_J._Armando\">Bombonera</a>, the home stadium of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Juniors\">Boca Juniors</a>. And this is a football club every Swede should now, because back in 1905 when the founders of the clubs were sitting together in the harbor of La Boca, contemplating which colors their new club should have, they decided that the flag of the next ship sailing by would decide the colors for their club. Let\'s just say that the players\' jerseys, the stadium, even some of the houses in the neighborhood are yellow and blue.<br /><br />MI BUENOS AIRES la comida - the food!<br /><br />Knowing me you know that I will have to talk about food. I had great hopes into the Argentinian cuisine before going to Buenos Aires. A country colonized by the Spanish with millions of Italian immigrants. That sounds like a marriage made in heaven. <br />Well true, you cannot tell an Argentinian how to grill his meat. Buy the best cut you can afford a little salt and straight on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asado\">parilla</a> - the Argentinian grill. Tastes sooo good!<br />But wouldn\'t you get bored to eat meat EVERY DAY? It seems Argentinians are so obsessed with their meats that they forgot to think about anything else. Argentina has a great choice of fresh and tasty vegetables, but the Argentinians have no idea on how to prepare them.  When it comes to spices it starts and ends with salt.

It is a good way to remember what actually happened. This time I am at <a href=\"http://swdc-central.com/\" id=\"vv-0\" title=\"Scandinavian Web Developer Conference\">Scandinavian Web Developer Conference</a> in Stockholm. About a hundred web hackers (as Mark Wubben called us) assembled at the old almost ancient <a href=\"http://www.sf.se/biografer/biograf?theatreid=139&amp;maccount=1003&amp;city=SE\" id=\"c312\" title=\"movie theatre Skandia\">movie theatre Skandia</a> at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drottninggatan,_Stockholm\" id=\"nk_:\" title=\"most popular shopping street\">most popular shopping street</a> in Stockholm. Quite a sight actually. Despite one late cancellation the schedule was absolutely packed. The conference is one track only so you don&#39;t get anxiety over choosing but on the other hand might get stuck with something boring. That was not a problem the first day. An uninteresting talk was also welcomed due to the need for some relaxation in between the very interesting stuff.<br /><br />The first day was about web development leaving mobile development for the second day. It started out with <a href=\"http://robertnyman.com/\" id=\"tbi7\" title=\"Robert Nymans\">Robert Nymans</a> talk about HTML5. I saw it a couple of weeks ago at <a href=\"http://robertnyman.com/2010/05/05/geek-meet-may-2010-html5-javascript/\" id=\"ny2s\" title=\"geek meet\">geek meet</a> so nothing new really. (Although it was refreshing to see the presentation evolving a bit since then.) HTML5 is obviously happening and due to its backwards compatiblity it can be used right away. Not all browsers support it but even a rather bad browser can be javascript shocked into liking the new tags of HTML5. This new version of the standard was brought up several times during the day in different context. The common consensus seems to be that it is a good step forward but there are still lots of pieces missing. The most serious critic came from <a href=\"http://www.wait-till-i.com/\" id=\"gp8z\" title=\"Chris Heilmann\">Chris Heilmann</a> in the ending talk of the day. It was a great talk on giving users what they really want. Not many users care at all what version of HTML that runs in their browser - even less what javascript framework we used to write it. They just need it for some non technical purpose. In this business we have a habit of extrapolating our own behaviour to that of our users. We all install new browers as soon as they appear and have modern smart phones in our pockets. Not so with our users. Some of them hate computers and have learned to change as little as possible to make sure that it doesn&#39;t break. This is a big failure of our industry. Obviously there are reasons users feel this way. It is not nice to tell users that they need to install another browser in order to use a site. Chris jokingly suggested that instead of just turning users away if they have IE6 we should use directx to blur the pages for them. This would cause user head aches and would eventually lead to corporations having to abandon IE6 in favour of modern web browsers. Chris talk was possibly the best of this day. CSS3 guy <a href=\"http://www.glazman.org/\" id=\"j-7p\" title=\"Daniel Glazman\">Daniel Glazman</a> also talked a bit about HTML5 in his talk called &quot;Browser War 2010&quot;. Actually the talk lacked mentions of the war but was nevertheless an interesting history lesson with some forward looking in the end.<br /><br />Another theme was code organisation. <a href=\"http://dylanschiemann.com/\" id=\"em7n\" title=\"Dylan Schiemann\">Dylan Schiemann</a> held a hilarious but a bit unstructured talk about dojo and motools showing how to work with encapsulation in Javascript. <a href=\"http://www.ilinsky.com/\" id=\"hxal\" title=\"Sergey Ilinsky\">Sergey Ilinsky</a> presented the <a href=\"http://www.amplesdk.com/\" id=\"a8nh\" title=\"Ample SDK\">Ample SDK</a> and argued for a declarative way to describe user interfaces. Apparently declarative most often means XML which is a bit strange to me. Couldn&#39;t any language be used for declarative style programming? And Rik Arends of ajax.org showcased a web based IDE for web development in the cloud. Pretty impressive but not totally obvious that the tool is truly useful. <a href=\"http://www.stpe.se/\" id=\"auev\" title=\"Stefan Pettersson\">Stefan Pettersson</a> also touched the subject of code organisation when talking about large scale javascript web sites. He gave us some good pointers about where to look for performance gains.<br /><br />More interesting was Alexander Langs talk on document databases. The examples he used were a bit naive perhaps but still made the point clearly. There are many use cases where document databases is preferrable. This subject is kind of a neighbor to <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/\" id=\"n0hh\" title=\"node.js\">node.js</a>. <a href=\"http://www.nonblocking.io/\" id=\"qj-q\" title=\"Malte Ubl\">Malte Ubl</a> held a great introduction that yet again made me want to try it out for real. I may even have to reorganize my list of new technologies for spare time exploring. The huge selling point for node.js is its performance characteristics. It is such a simple and beuatiful idea - to get away from processes and threads waiting for stuff to complete and instead have a truly asynchronous solution.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://wordpress.chanezon.com/\" id=\"cezb\" title=\"Patrick Chanezon\">Patrick Chanezon</a> of Google walked us through Googles cloud offering and showed how to create a web site using GWT and app engine. It felt strange to see someone actually compiling something not to mention running eclipse. It was a strange sensation in this context. Another Googleoriented talk was <a href=\"http://novemberborn.net/\" id=\"ibn_\" title=\"Mark Wubbens\">Mark Wubbens</a> brilliant introduction to building <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/extensions/?hl=en\" id=\"rv3y\" title=\"Chrome extensions\">Chrome extensions</a>. With a couple of really nice and thoughtful examples he guided us through the important features of Chrome extensions. It is actually similar to Greasemonkey scripts for Firefox and it is apparently the same guy now working for google.<br /><br />All in all - the first day was great. Thanks a lot to <a href=\"http://unclescript.blogspot.com/\" id=\"xq.e\" title=\"Peter Svensson\">Peter Svensson</a> and his crew!

Compared to other conferences the emphasis on interaction is very refreshing. Lightning talks I attended today was:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.responsive.se/thomas/\" id=\"wnbn\" title=\"Thomas Nilsson\">Thomas Nilsson</a> started the day with the talk Flight of the Agile. He argued that there may not be the one agile way. Circumstances, staffing and the like may call for another approach then the purist way. This is a fair call and something that has been iterated over several times these two days. I hear an echo of Alistair Cockburns <a href=\"http://alistair.cockburn.us/Crystal+methodologies\" id=\"y7oz\" title=\"agile method called crystal\">agile method called crystal</a>.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.valtech.se/sv/Konsulter/Andreas-Ekstrom/\" id=\"ldg7\" title=\"Andreas Ekström\">Andreas Ekström</a> talked about BDD and cucumber.</li><li><a href=\"http://blog.avegagroup.se/ChristopheAchouiantz/Default.aspx\" id=\"owat\" title=\"Christophe Achouiantz\">Christophe Achouiantz</a> (wow - avega has an asp site) uses Kanban as a way to organize many scrum teams. The idea is to have backlog items on a kanban board and every team has a row. This brings good overview of the overall progress. It looked really good and is something I will try if I ever get the chance.</li><li>Inga-Lill Holmström from Ericsson talked about using anatomies as a complement to the product back log. I am not sure about the point with the word &quot;anatomies&quot; when what it really is is just dependency trees of product features or team activities. (Called system anatomies and program anatomies in Ericsson lingo.) I guess anatomy is just a word that Ericsson is used to. Many of us outsiders probably went huh.</li><li>Agile managers was the title of <a href=\"http://blog.crisp.se/tomasbjorkholm/\" id=\"jvzj\" title=\"Tomas Björkholms\">Tomas Björkholms</a> talk. It was an entertaining talk where Tomas used the agile manifesto pointing out the managers just must love it. And he is right of course.</li><li><a href=\"http://johlrogge.wordpress.com/\" id=\"d0qr\" title=\"Joakim Ohlrogge\">Joakim Ohlrogge</a> used the tv series friends to bring a fresh approach. Nicely done and it fuelled the open space about artistic development a bit.</li><li>Staffan Persson thought that lean architecture was worth talking about. I am not convinced that the architecture metaphor is still useful.</li><li><a href=\"http://annaforss.wordpress.com/\" id=\"cu7l\" title=\"Anna Forss\">Anna Forss</a> thought that Microsoft Project can ruin a project but still recommended the tool at the end.</li><li>Kristina Josefsson och Carolina Palo Kobak brought experiences from using Scrum in a management team at TeliaSonera to the table.</li><li><a href=\"http://danielbrolund.wordpress.com/\" id=\"em6w\" title=\"Daniel Brolund\">Daniel Brolund</a> held an excellent talk about being a goldfish. He argued for staying simple at all times. &quot;What would a goldfish think about this?&quot; is a good question to ask. Very entertaining and thought provoking.</li><li>Anders Nilsson and an author whose name has been forgotten talked about two extremes of agile teams. Extreme chaos or extreme discipline. The point being - naturally - that &#39;lagom&#39; is just enough.</li><li>David Asarnoj reported from a scrum and ITIL organisation. Two different mindsets that doesn&#39;t naturally have much in common. Interesting questions put forward that were elaborated further in an open space.</li><li><a href=\"http://dearjunior.blogspot.com/\" id=\"g93t\" title=\"Dan Bergh Johnsson\">Dan Bergh Johnsson</a> presented the agile stack of Scrum, BDD and DDD. At this point I was tired enough to drift away a bit and can not really report anything useful....</li><li><a href=\"http://microserf.wordpress.com/\" id=\"th-2\" title=\"Peter Hultgren\">Peter Hultgren</a> presented code sparring - a way to train coding where a group meets and pair programs for a while then throws away the code and start over with new pairs. An interesting concept that surely can complement coding dojos and personal kata practices.</li><li>Finally Marcus Ahnve argued that we need experts but we don&#39;t need experts that are only experts. Everyone should try to have a little knowledge about all disciplines needed in the agile team. In that way everyone can work on most tasks.</li></ul><p>Today there were only two open spaces since the third slot was reserved for retrospection. I first open spaced about what agile means. A nicely organized brain storm about agile on 6 different levels. The organizers promised a write down of the result somewhere and I will either tweet about it or post it here. The second space was about artistic development. A very interesting subject where we explored comparing software development to performing arts. Many things are similar like timeboxing, a team that needs trust to perform, product owner/scrum master can be likened to producer/director/writer in a performing group. No conclusions were made but I think we all agreed that a creative and artistic mindset is part of a successful software story.<br /><br />Two questions worth pondering was put forth repetitiously during the conference. Why is the consultant ratio at the conference about 80%? And why do we all agree? Several open spaces were held around these two questions. A skeptic might say that agila sverige is a conference where consultants get together to complain about the lack of agility in their customers. We decide to stay outside organisations with structural problems and sort of hope that they will change by themselves. If we just shout our agile message loudly enough they will understand. Isn&#39;t it first when you really are in an organization that you are able to change it? I have no answer to this. In the meantime I will keep trying to communicate my values to whomever I happen to work with. Sometimes it will make a difference and sometimes it will not.<br /><br />To summarize I must say that agila sverige positively surprised me. I expected a great conference but my expectations were exceeded. Lots of thanks to the organizers and I hope to meet you all next year!</p>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 246,"revision_id": 246,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "<div>The <a href=\"http://agilasverige.se/program/monday\" id=\"o_.f\" title=\"first day\">first day</a> of <a href=\"http://agilasverige.se/\" id=\"xrwu\" title=\"agila sverige\">agila sverige</a> is over. It is a very intense conference that is not only about agile software development but also claims to be agile in itself. This is manifested with 10 minute lightning talks in the morning and open space after lunch. So there are many speakers to start the day with (about 30 talks in 3 hours) and the audience itself set the afternoon agenda. I think it is a very nice format. The balance between lightnings talks and open space is really good. The lightning talks I attended were:<br /><br /><ul><li><a href=\"http://jockeholm.wordpress.com/\" id=\"t:5e\" title=\"Jocke Holm\">Jocke Holm</a> talking about the HUGE misunderstanding that software creation is a kind of manufacturing. He argued that coding is design. I totally agree with this and a previous <a href=\"http://www.highlevelbits.com/2009/05/software-development-as-mapping.html\" id=\"r541\" title=\"post of mine\">post of mine</a> addresses the same issue but from the architecture metaphor angle and with a different suggested solution.</li><li>Anders Ivarsson on a similar subject - agile language. He argued that agile methods essentially has positioned themselves as opposite of older methodologies and that this has influenced the language we use to describe the method. He made the point that agile methods should be able to stand on their own - not to &quot;just&quot; be something that is relative to something else.</li><li>Carina Meurlinger on how agile meets old style reward systems. This was a talk aimed at scared managers I think and I floated away a bit. You can&#39;t do that when it is only 10 minutes.....</li><li>Vim! <a href=\"http://www.valtech.se/sv/Konsulter/Niklas-Lindstrom/\" id=\"e.t9\" title=\"Niklas Lindström\">Niklas Lindström</a> had a really passionate talk on the vim editor. It was interesting for me that just recently decided to finally learn to use vi/vim. The unix command line skills is not complete without it.</li><li>Fredrik Sjöö talked a little about the agile challenges of game development and then showed a commercial of their next game. NOT OK.</li><li>The pomodoro guy - <a href=\"http://blog.staffannoteberg.com/\" id=\"kat0\" title=\"Staffan Nöteberg\">Staffan Nöteberg</a> - a very skilled speaker talked about time boxed thinking - or rather he made us do an exercise to experience time boxed thinking. Very pedagogical!</li><li>Anna Herting talked pragmatically about agile documentation. Write what is needed but not more.</li><li><a href=\"http://manssandstrom.wordpress.com/\" id=\"hquh\" title=\"Måns Sandström\">Måns Sandström</a> argued that the new tester is more of a specifier. Testing should be done as early as possible and can then be the same thing as writing the specification of the system.</li><li><a href=\"http://ellnestam.wordpress.com/\" id=\"u0vw\" title=\"Ola Ellnestam\">Ola Ellnestam</a> talked about the meta activity of leading leaders. (I automatically related this topic to the numerous cases when myself or other team members has micro managed the formal leader to ensure a good result from the project.)</li><li>Elin Uppström used her 2 year old child as an example of how important it is to have a shared goal.</li><li>Then Måns Sandström again - this time about how to use erlang for story driven development. Since erlang is a functional language the normal given-when-then cycle of behavorial test frameworks like cucumber or rspec doesn&#39;t work. There can be no given when working non OO - there are no side effects in the functional paradigm. This actually makes it easier to write tests contrary to what some people claims. Måns has written a testing framework in Erlang called Cloudberry.</li><li><a href=\"http://microserf.wordpress.com/\">Peter Hultgren</a> has started with personal kanban - yet another way to organize your life. The most important aspect - as in &#39;normal&#39; kanban - is the concept of work in progress (WIP). It makes you focus at one task at a time instead of spreading and waisting your energy on many concurrent tasks. Peter helped us with a couple of mind games. <a href=\"http://microserf.wordpress.com/2009/10/30/using-a-personal-kanban-board/\">Read more...</a></li><li>Torbjörn Kalin talked about the hard agile life when doing product development. I found his points a bit exaggerated but maybe that was the point.....</li><li>Finally <a href=\"http://johlrogge.wordpress.com/\" id=\"xo1o\" title=\"Joakim Ohlrogge\">Joakim Ohlrogge</a> said some wise things about bugs. We sometimes talk about bugs that &quot;appears&quot; when it is always the case that the bug has been coded by a developer. Developers should take responsibility for their code.</li></ul></div><br /><p>I started open space with moods - an interesting discussion on how our mood affects our work and how our work can affect our mood too. An idea brought forward was to track moods in the same way as we track progress in a scrum team so that a retrospective can follow up on the moods as well as on the progress. I am not sure this is really useful - a better approach is to make sure that you have leaders with enough skills in empathy so that they can read team members and react when there is a mood related problem. I then went to a discussion on how to get good teams that work together towards a common goal. There was lots of sharing and brain storming to help each other out in the &quot;real world&quot;. The last open space was called &quot;does it matter?&quot; and related to methods. Does it really matter which method we use? Isn&#39;t it easier to just put a bunch of great developers in a room an let them just do whatever they think is great? Rather than kill them with methods whether or not those methods are agile or not? The group came to no conclusion but held a really interesting and passionate discussion.<br /><br />The venue - <a href=\"http://www.citykonferensen.se/\" id=\"a0o7\" title=\"Citykonferensen\">Citykonferensen</a> - a kind of old school conference centre is really nice and well suited to the task. Food and fika was good and the dinner at <a href=\"http://www.tendermat.se/\" id=\"p_s6\" title=\"Tender\">Tender</a> was really great. It was good to end the day with some even more informal talks around the dinner table.

A friend recommended to only index what you really need. For me the most important feature of spotlight is to start applications, so I decided to change the settings. But how do I trigger a re-index? A little googling and I found several tips which recommend to change the index configuration in the preferences pane and then after a few minutes change it back. The idea being &quot;trick spotlight into indexing&quot;. Even though this approach probably works it just felt wrong and I decided to dig deeper. Here is what I found:</p>

<code>sudo mdutil -E /</code></pre>
<p>This command will immediately force spotlight into a re-indexing your main disc.<br />Once on the right track I found out that there is a whole range of spotlight related tools - <i>mdfind</i>, <i>mdimport</i>, <i>mdls</i> and <i>mdutil</i>.

This morning I attended a breakfast seminar at Stockholm consultants <a href=\"http://www.msc.se/index.html\">MSC</a> held by <a href=\"http://goran.krampe.se/blog\">Göran Krampe</a> about <a href=\"http://seaside.st/\">Seaside</a>. I have read some about it earlier and put it on the huge list of things to try later (together with erlang, haskell, an infinite number of javascript frameworks not excluding <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/\">node.js</a>, python with <a href=\"http://www.djangoproject.com/\">django</a> etc etc ). But when <a href=\"http://divineprogrammer.blogspot.com/\">Mikael Kindborgs</a> colleague at MSC is holding a seminar on the topic it sure is interesting to attend and I must admit that I now feel that Seaside probably will be the technology used for the next hobby project for me. Why? I will paraphrase some of what Göran said and add some of my own so here goes:</p><ul><li>no templates - you don&#39;t have to touch HTML at all. This means that (1) method calls for a tag makes sure that tag is properly rendered so no problem with nonclosing tags etc. (2) the kind of mess where tags are intermingled with &quot;normal&quot; code is gone, (3) the HTML looks really good and (4) no risk of using messy techniques for styling - you have to put it all in the global CSS file.</li><li>the server is not stateless. This may be a problem in extremely large applications but for most cases a bit of load balancing with sticky sessions will solve it with no problem. Session state is communicated with a request parameter so no cookies are involved. And the other parameter is for identifying the continuation.</li><li>Smalltalk is a really nice language. It has the simplest syntax possible and all and everything is objects. It would be nice to get more hands on experience with the language. Lots of the good stuff in software development comes from the smalltalk community. It is probably because the barriers for accomplishing things is much lower than in other languages.</li><li>no XML and no configuration files. You write it all in Smalltalk. This is - of course - similar to Rails where everything is Ruby. A very nice and reasonable approach.</li><li>no builds. Smalltalk runs in its own virtual machine with something called an image that holds the current object state of everything. Kind of like EJB stateful session beans but good.... Code changes in the development environment is runnable at once. This is no news for Smalltalk developers but for a Java web developer it may sound too good to be true. Seaside adds a nice debug environment to your web pages where you can inspect and change the code from within the browser. Imagine doing that with a JSP-based framework in the J2EE stack.</li><li>Seaside is &#39;just a web framework&#39;. Unlike Rails and django it doesn&#39;t solve all your problems. For persistence you have to hook into other Smalltalk solutions. For the enterprise - <a href=\"http://www.gemstone.com/\">Gemstone</a> may be interesting with its powerful object database.</li></ul><p>So - many thanks to Göran Krampe for awakening my interest in Seaside (and Smalltalk).</p>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 249,"revision_id": 249,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "<p>Inspired by this Rand&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2009/12/24/a_creative_soundtrack.html\">blog</a> I gave <a href=\"http://www.ommwriter.com/\">Ommwriter</a> a go. Opening an existing text file I was surprised though to be greeted by something like this:</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_large\",\"fid\":\"89\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"class\":\"media-image\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\"}}]]</p><p>Unfortunately, I must have accidentally saved the file before I was able to exit the Ommwriter, because when I tried to reopen the file in TextEdit I got the same result. I was pretty sure I was encountering an encoding problem. Time for <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">iconv</span>. The default encoding on my Mac is UTF-8 so I tried something like:</p>

<code>iconv -f UTF-8 -t UTF-16 foo.txt
</code></pre>
<p>And lo and behold I got my text back. After investigating the problem for a little bit I found out that the problem occurs when the text contains characters outside the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">[A-Z]</span> and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">[a-z]</span> range, for example an ö.<br /><br />Anyways, after this initial hiccup, I have to admit I am positively surprised about Ommwriter. The fact that all distractions are removed from the screen really helps focusing on the actual task of writing. I also like that there is <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">no</span> spell checker. You are actually focusing on writing and not proof reading. Most surprised I was, however, by the fact that audible keyboard strokes actually really help the writing process.</p>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 250,"revision_id": 250,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "<p>Tigris, The Paraná Delta &amp; Isla Martin Garcia,<br /><br />A great trip while in Buenos Aires is a visit to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paran%C3%A1_Delta\">Paraná Delta</a>. The Delta is a 14000 km<sup>2</sup> area of islands, inlets, water channels, rivers and backwaters. It&#39;s a great area to explore and you get away from the hustle and bustle of Buenos Aires. On weekends legions of people flock to Tigre, the gateway to the Delta and you will see massive queues infront of the shuttle boats taking you out onto the many waterways.<br /><br />Tigre is about a 1 1/2 hour bus ride (number 60) from the city. Alternatively you can take the train from Retiro or the <a href=\"http://www.trendelacosta.com.ar/\">Tren de la Costa</a>. However,&nbsp; the latter is definitely overpriced and it charges tourist prices! I find Tigre itself quite boring. There is the <a href=\"http://www.puertodefrutos-arg.com.ar/\">Puerto De Frutos</a>, a major tourist market, but that&#39;s about it. There is also the Tigre Casino, but that&#39;s a rather sad than exiting place. Worst of all, there does not to be a decent restaurant in town. The best recommodation I can give is a grilled chicken take away called <a href=\"http://es-la.facebook.com/pages/Tigre-Argentina/super-pollo-parrilla/350654054157?v=info\">Super Pollo</a>.<br /><br />A great day excursion you can do from Tigre is to visit <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isla_Mart%C3%ADn_Garc%C3%ADa\">Isla Martin Garcia</a>. It&#39;s a three hours boat ride to this island. The boat leaves at 9 am, so if you are coming from Buenos Aires you will have an early start. Alternatively you sleep over in Tigre and start the day in a less stressful way.<br /><br />Isla Martin Garcia is not really part of the Paraná Delta, but rather lies in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_la_Plata\">Rio de la Plata</a> closer to Uruguy than to Argentina. The highlight of the whole trip is the 3 hour boat ride itself. The first 1 1/2 hours take you through the Delta and afterwards you are crusing up the Rio de la Plata. If you are lucky you can sit outside on the roof of the boat and let the secenery pass by. Once you turn into the Rio de la Plata it is worth to have a look back. You will be rewarded with a view of the Buenos Aires skyline in the distance.<br /><br />On Martin Garcia you get a one hour guided tour around the inhabited&nbsp; part of the Island. There are some interesting details about the island. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peron\">Juan Perón</a> was once imprisoned on the island and one of the first practisioners of blood transfusions - <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Agote\">Luis Agote</a> - was living and working there. Today the island is owned by the government and the people living there only lease there homes from the government. Bird watchers will love the island since it offers excellent bird watching oppertunities and if you like other wild life you can try to spot one of the many lizards inhabiting the island. And in case the local bakery is open make sure to get a pan dulce. The pan dulce from Martin Garcia is renowned in whole Buenos Aires.<br /><br />Here are some pictures from our trip to Martin Garcia.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_large\",\"fid\":\"90\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"class\":\"media-image\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\"}}]]</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_large\",\"fid\":\"91\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"class\":\"media-image\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\"}}]]</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_large\",\"fid\":\"92\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"class\":\"media-image\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\"}}]]</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_large\",\"fid\":\"93\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"class\":\"media-image\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\"}}]]</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_large\",\"fid\":\"94\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"class\":\"media-image\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\"}}]]</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_large\",\"fid\":\"95\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"class\":\"media-image\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\"}}]]</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_large\",\"fid\":\"96\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"class\":\"media-image\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\"}}]]</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_large\",\"fid\":\"97\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"class\":\"media-image\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\"}}]]</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_large\",\"fid\":\"98\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"class\":\"media-image\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\"}}]]</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_large\",\"fid\":\"99\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"class\":\"media-image\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\"}}]]</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_large\",\"fid\":\"100\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"class\":\"media-image\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\"}}]]</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</div>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 251,"revision_id": 251,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "<p>I have spent this day in the warm embrace of <a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/\" id=\"qzbm\" title=\"Oracle\">Oracle</a>.

Naturally the acquisition is a big event in the computer world affecting everyone writing software in Java and making Oracle into another IBM. Suddenly Oracle not only have the full suit of software needed to run a business - they also have Suns outstanding hardware. This means - as the suits pointed out over and over again - that they can deliver integrated solutions with extreme everything (seems like the pool of superlatives is running out - the word extreme appeared more than once). Still they vow to continue supporting open standards so that the result is not another vendor look in alá Microsoft. In practice though it may effectively leave customers with the choice of buying the full Oracle stack or spending lots of money integrating parts of the stack with products from other vendors. This is probably not a good thing for the diversity of software business. Some other sightings that may or may not scare you:</p><ul><li>every Oracle presentation starts with a legal disclaimer slide - kind of nicely sums up the corporate culture</li><li>new elevator message: &quot;Software.

Just a bit of support....</li><li><a href=\"http://nl.linkedin.com/in/martijnvlek\" id=\"df_y\" title=\"Martijn Vlek\">Martijn Vlek</a> - the middleware suit - said: &quot;We are very proud of sort of &#39;own&#39; Java now.&quot;</li></ul><div>&nbsp;</div><div>This fluffy event was repetitious and not very dense so I slipped away for some Rails coding and a geocaching walk before the stuffy event.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The JavaForum stuff started with <a href=\"http://twitter.com/danbjson\" id=\"k25r\" title=\"Dan Bergh Johnsson\">Dan Bergh Johnsson</a> talking about future performance problems and how we should solve them with event driven architecture. He probably meant JMS on the server side. I agree that we have a problem with performance when integrating all our systems but I am pretty sure that JMS isn&#39;t the way forward. This whole issue may call for another blog post actually. We&#39;ll see. Then <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/adammessinger\" id=\"i6dv\" title=\"Adam Messinger\">Adam Messinger</a> who works as Vice President Development Fusion Middleware at Oracle talked vaguely about Oracles strategy for Java. It was pretty much the same message as during the fluffy session. Everything will be supported for a while but in most overlap cases the Oracle solution will be the strategic product of the future. It feels a bit like they want to sound like the good guy now but they might do whatever in the future. The serious part of the evening ended with a panel of mostly oraclers taking questions from the audience. Some really interesting questions were brought forward but the Oracles reps didn&#39;t really answer much of them.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>My personal feeling about the merger is that I couldn&#39;t care less. I don&#39;t care much for the Java world anymore. Long gone are the times when I looked forward to new interesting articles in JavaWorld. Java is a nice language but there are far superior languages to use in most cases. Java - or rather the JVM - as a platform for other languages is really cool. The enterprise thingie is just a big mess of stuff without real value to the business. And I don&#39;t think Oracle will make it much worse.

(Thank you Google! Do you own my soul now? And another thank you to <a href=\"http://twitter.com/psvensson\" id=\"vg-8\" title=\"Peter Svensson\">Peter Svensson</a> that made GTUG happen in Stockholm.) This is possibly the best phone I have ever owned so here are a couple of notes after using it for about a month. My previous phone was a Nokia N95 which was ok but not outstanding at all.<br />&nbsp;</p><div>The <b>screen</b> is awesome. With a great resolution (800x480 compared to 480x320 on the iphone) all applications feels crisp and looks great. It is even possible to watch youtube videos with no apparent loss of video quality.</div><br /><div>The <b>virtual keyboard</b> is a bit hard to get used to but I think it will prove useful in the end. I probably type faster on it then on a standard phone keyboard. While typing english it is also great with suggestions. Typing in swedish is not so good.....</div><br /><p>It is possible to run things <b>concurrently</b>. I can listen to <a href=\"https://www.spotify.com/\" id=\"ud5k\" title=\"Spotify\">Spotify</a> while browsing the Internet or running sports tracker <a href=\"http://www.endomondo.com/\" id=\"z-pp\" title=\"Endomondo\">Endomondo</a>. The possibility to run things in the background and switch seamlessly between applications makes the device more powerful.<br />&nbsp;</p><div>I got a <b>4GB SD card</b> with the phone. This means that I can have a spotify list of 500 songs stored on the device. This is really needed since Spotify does not run well in online 3G mode. 3G probably isn&#39;t fast enough yet. Spotify manages online/offline without me having to do anyting more than (un)checking boxes.<br /><br />There is a <b>GPS</b> in the phone that works really nice. It finds my location really fast. With my Nokia I had to stand still for a minute while the GPS searched for satellites - not good..... This means that Endomondo, Google Maps, Google Earth, <a href=\"http://foursquare.com/\" id=\"mv5o\" title=\"foursquare\">foursquare</a>, <a href=\"http://gowalla.com/\" id=\"aqr1\" title=\"gowalla\">gowalla</a>, twidroid et al knows my position fairly well most of the time. While being outside..... And this is of course a prerequisite for augmented reality apps - more on that later.</div><br /><div>The <b>browser</b> is really good. It has multi touch support so it is easy to navigate pages. I was satisfied with the built-in browser in my N95 but this one is so much better. One reason is the great <a href=\"http://reader.google.com/\" id=\"ophi\" title=\"Google Reader\">Google Reader</a> mobile implementation that makes it easy to keep up with feeds when on the move (or in meetings). The possibility of changing the phones orientation to landscape mode makes most web pages readable even when the text is a bit wide.</div><br /><div>There are some <b>augmented reality</b> apps for the phone. I have tried <a href=\"http://www.google.com/mobile/goggles/\" id=\"mcr_\" title=\"Google Goggles\">Google Goggles</a> and <a href=\"http://layar.com/\" id=\"obqw\" title=\"Layar\">Layar</a> and there probably are a couple more that I don&#39;t know of. Goggles is a kind of search through the camera. You point and something and click and in some cases you get a decent search result or a similar picture out of it. It is supposed to work great with landmarks but I don&#39;t think any building out in Sollentuna qualifies as such... It also scans text and sometimes finds appropriate search results. I tried it with a wine bottle and it correctly found the site of the wine maker. Other trademarks doesn&#39;t work so well. A Cola label didn&#39;t work at all. It looks like they are crowd sourcing the results so maybe it is improving organically somehow.... It is a cool app anyway! Layar is a framework for viewing &quot;points of interest&quot; through the devices camera. Layar provide the engine and third parties provide with list of points. Anyone can setup a back end layer that serves points to layar. Examples of layers to use in layar are nearby tweets, geolocated wikipedia entries and max burger joints. Augmented reality are certainly a technology of the future and once screen technologies move away from the handheld to retinal projection or useful head-mounted displays this will really take off. (2020?) An interesting development to follow. <span style=\"font-size: 78%;\">[<a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/02/augmented-reality-and-the-ulti.html\" id=\"i:l:\" title=\"interesting about augmented reality user manuals\">interesting about augmented reality user manuals</a>]</span></div><br /><div>A local app that has been really useful is <a href=\"http://twitter.com/johanni\" id=\"lfdz\" title=\"Johan Nilssons\">Johan Nilssons</a> <b>local commute planning tool</b>. It is a front for the journey planner at www.sl.se. It works really great with the GPS and you can save commonly used locations. It is one case when the phone seriously beats your desktop computer.</div><br /><div>Another thing that may seem trivial but that REALLY WORKS is the <b>calculator</b>. On a &quot;normal&quot; phone calculating stuff involves lots of button pressing. With the touch screen it is just as easy as a special purpose calculator.</div><br /><div>And of course - being a &quot;professional&quot; Java developer - I can <b>code my own apps</b>. Haven&#39;t really done much yet but after the current side project there may be some more android coding. And despite being Java it is a really cool platform to work with. There are also lots of initiatives that will bring dynamic languages to the platform. Check - for example - out <a href=\"http://twitter.com/divineprog\" id=\"mr5q\" title=\"Mikael Kindborgs\">Mikael Kindborgs</a> effort on bringing Javascript to the platform. He calls it droidscript and <a href=\"http://droidscript.blogspot.com/\" id=\"z1w2\" title=\"blogs about\">blogs about</a> it. I really wish I had more time to try these cool things out.</div><br /><div>The least useful but possibly coolest feature is <b>live wallpapers</b>. They are downloadable from the store like any normal app and there really aren&#39;t anything more to say about them.... I can have <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_digital_rain\" id=\"wqs_\" title=\"digital rain\">digital rain</a> on my phone and that makes me a bit more happy....</div><br /><div>A downside in sweden is that the market for apps is only serving free apps at the moment. There are probably a whole bunch of great apps to pay for that I can&#39;t download yet.</div><div>&nbsp;</div>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 253,"revision_id": 253,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "<p>The other day I wanted to rename a whole bunch of images with spaces and brackets in them. I had files of the form <i>filename1 (1).JPG</i>, <i>filename1 (2).JPG</i>, ..., <i>filename2 (1).JPG</i>, ...<br />In case you are wondering, these file came from a windows box where copies of files get saved in the format filename<space>(<index>).xyz. I know that from a OS point of view spaces in file names are no problem, but hell are spaces a pita if you have to process the files in a script. So what I wanted to do was to remove the space with a &#39;_&#39;, replace the brackets and while on it lowercase the filenames (I really just don&#39;t like JPG, I want jpg). For these kind of problems I would normally try a for loop. Here is my first attempt:</index></space><br />&nbsp;</p>
<pre style=\"background-color: #eeeeee; border: 1px dashed rgb(153, 153, 153); color: black; font-family: Andale Mono,Lucida Console,Monaco,fixed,monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 14px; overflow: auto; padding: 5px; width: 100%;\">
<code>for i in `ls -1 *.JPG`; do j=`echo $i | tr -d &quot;[:blank:]&quot; | tr &quot;[:upper:]&quot; &quot;[:lower:]&quot; | tr &quot;(&quot; &quot;_&quot; | tr -d &quot;)&quot;`; mv &quot;$i&quot; &quot;$j&quot;; done
</code></pre>
<br /><p>The idea is to process each file name in a loop, transform the filename with a a set of <i>tr</i> calls and then do a final rename of the files using <i>mv</i>. <i>tr</i> takes its input from standard in and writes to standard out, hence the trick of first echoing the current value of the iteration, passing it through several <i>tr</i> calls and then assigning it to a temporary variable. Note the use of the character classes for the transformation via <i>tr</i>.<br /><br />This one liner works fine for file names without spaces, but as soon as there are spaces in the file names you are getting into trouble. The default field separator of a for loop is the space character which means file names with spaces are causing two iterations of the loop. One solution to the problem is to set the $IFS variable prior to executing the for loop. The value of this variable determines the field separator. However, in this case you also have to remember to reset the variable afterward.<br /><br />Another approach is to&nbsp; use a completely different construct which you don&#39;t see so often. Let&#39;s use <i>find</i> together with a <i>while</i> loop.<br />&nbsp;</p>
<pre style=\"background-color: #eeeeee; border: 1px dashed rgb(153, 153, 153); color: black; font-family: Andale Mono,Lucida Console,Monaco,fixed,monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 14px; overflow: auto; padding: 5px; width: 100%;\">
<code>find . -name &quot;*.JPG&quot; -print0 | while read -d $&#39;\\0&#39; file; do j=`echo $file | tr -d &quot;[:blank:]&quot; | tr &quot;[:upper:]&quot; &quot;[:lower:]&quot; | tr &quot;(&quot; &quot;_&quot; | tr -d &quot;)&quot;`; mv &quot;$file&quot; $j; done
</code></pre>
<br /><p>We use <i>find</i> together with the <i>-print0</i> option to print all file names into one line separated by a ASCII NUL character. In the loop we use <i>read </i>together with the <i>-d</i> option which determines the delimiter for <i>read</i>. The rest is the same as in the <i>for</i> loop solution.<br /><br />Hope this helps some people, but maybe its just me who gets frustrated with spaces in file names ;-)<br /><br />Enjoy,<br />Hardy</p>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 254,"revision_id": 254,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "<p>Fredrik and I are working on a little Rails app at the moment (more to this in a later post) and decided to host it on <a href=\"http://www.site5.com/\">Site 5</a>.

It is written in Ruby and installs as a gem. Build scripts are also Ruby with everything that comes with it. It is built with the good things of maven as role model and with the less fortunate aspects of maven as frightening example. Dependencies are downloaded from maven repos and local builds can be installed to a local maven repo. To try it out I cd&#39;d into a directory with a maven pom.xml and ran buildr. It gave me the choice of creating a build file from the maven pom or from the directory structure. When choosing maven pom the generated build file was about half the size of the pom. Now this was used on a very simple pom and according to Anders it may not work at all with more complex maven projects. buildr can do all the typical tasks of a build system and if something extraordinary is needed it is easy to script it with ruby.</p><p>Some advantages of buildr: (1) it is Ruby which enables &quot;real&quot; programming in build files, (2) it is Ruby which makes it possible to write build files that looks really nice (3) it is not XML - anyone tired of scripting in XML? (4) it includes the good parts of maven. Some disadvantages: (1) it is Ruby which may result in Perlish code if not careful, (2) it is not Java and XML (thank God) which may make it hard to introduce in larger organisations with static developers. If I was to pick a build system for my own use I would choose buildr but then I perhaps wouldn&#39;t choose Java as and the need wouldn&#39;t be there.... For larger organisations with competence problems it may be hard to introduce buildr over maven or ant. The threshold into ruby may be a little bit too high for the average java developer.</p><p>Anders also went through cucumber - a really nice testing tool that non-dev people can understand - and rake - Ruby make. &quot;rake -T&quot; will be remembered - it will come in handy when forgetting the howtos when coding rails in spare hours.</p><p>UPDATE: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/peter_lind\">Peter Lind</a> pointed in two more alternatives to buildr. If you use JRuby you can use Ant and Rake interchangeable as described in <a href=\"http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2010/rake-and-ant-together-a-pick-it-n-stick-it-approach/\">this post</a>. Advantages with this approach is that you rely entirely on stable technologies. buildr is a bit new and may not work for all cases yet. And then - of course - there is <a href=\"http://polyglot.sonatype.org/\">polyglot maven</a> that promises to: &quot;<i>to leverage the power of Maven through modern JVM language implementations like Groovy, Scala, Clojure and JRuby</i>&quot;. Seems like everyone is heading in each others directions.....</p><p>PS.

Even Lonley Planet would only lists the web address of Buquebus. We used Buquebus back in December for a short trip to Colonia and these guys charged a killing. It seems they can, because they dominated the market. Some people even go so far as to imply Columbian mafia connections ;-)<br />But there are alternatives and one of them is called <a href=\"http://www.seacatcolonia.com/\">Seacat</a>. Ups, now I spilled the beans! We used them just a couple of weekends ago to get to Montevideo and it only cost us a fraction of what the shorter trip to Colonia has cost us earlier. The best part of it all is that Seacat leaves from the same new fancy terminal building in Puerto Madero which all people believe is exclusively used by Buquebus. In fact our taxi driver who brought us there kept telling us during the whole way that he did not think that there are any other boats leaving from there.<br /><br />Montevideo itself was great for a weekend, but wouldn&#39;t have liked to stay much longer. People say that going to Montevideo is like time travel and you see Buenos Aires in the 1940ties, which is partly true. Unfortunately, there are other sides to it gave my experience of Montevideo a negative touch. A certain decay was noticeable in many neighborhoods and it felt that the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixing_Broken_Windows\">broken window syndrome</a> was at play, only that people have given up fixing them :(<br /><br />Nevertheless, there are a few great spots you should visit in case you get the chance.</p><ul><li>The Mausoleo de Artigas</li></ul><p style=\"text-align: center;\">[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_large\",\"fid\":\"101\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"class\":\"media-image\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\"}}]]</p><ul><li>Teatro Solis - make sure to get a tour and enjoy a coffee in the new refurbished cafe.

Cameron Purdy from <a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/\" id=\"yj7n\" title=\"Oracle\">Oracle</a> couldn&#39;t say much due to the <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23snorcle\" id=\"kw38\" title=\"snorcle\">snorcle</a> press conference later today on the acquisition of Sun. Still it was not the worst keynote ever. I think it grabbed a second place far ahead of javafx and robots and far behind first years nice talk on java as open source by Simon Phipps.</p><p>Then off to the thought challenging talk on unconscious taylorism by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/mahnve\" id=\"w_dm\" title=\"Marcus Ahnve\">Marcus Ahnve</a>. He traced a lot of our problems with software back to the early days of industrialism and its emphasis on an effective overall system. Every task was specialized and performed in batches leading to skills oriented organisations. You know . system architects in one group and developers in another, usability experts in one group and system analysts in another, maintenance in one place, operations in another and development in a dependency position to the former two. This is the way most organisations do their work. It is like a big engineering practice. Marcus emphasized the need for individuals quoting the <a href=\"http://agilemanifesto.org/\" id=\"yk.1\" title=\"agile manifesto\">agile manifesto</a>: &quot;Individuals and interactions over processes and tools&quot;. It was not clear from the speech why this emphasis is good. My answer is that software development is a creative process where the individual must be given a good environment to be creative in. The talk reminded me a lot of Richard Durnalls splendid JAOO talk on &quot;The IT division. Refactored&quot; (<a href=\"http://www.highlevelbits.com/2009/10/3rd-day-of-jaoo-and-wrap-up.html\" id=\"x0lk\" title=\"review here\">review here</a>). They both cited Matsushita on the western failure and while Richard talked more about the alternative (process oriented organisations), Marcus talked more about the cause. Another reference that popped into my head was <a href=\"http://the-programmers-stone.com/\" id=\"kkub\" title=\"the programmers stone\">the programmers stone</a>. Marcus referenced some non technical guy that talked about them and us, evil and good - it sounded a lot like the mapper - packer thing in the programmers stone. I liked this talk a lot and afterwards I&#39;ve been thinking that there may be similar causes for the use of the &quot;architecture&quot; metaphor - <a href=\"http://www.highlevelbits.com/2009/05/software-development-as-mapping.html\" id=\"r5-3\" title=\"bashed here\">bashed here</a>.</p><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Next I went to the pair programming show where <a href=\"http://niclasnilsson.se/\" id=\"i8qu\" title=\"Niclas Nilsson\">Niclas Nilsson</a> and <a href=\"http://www.crisp.se/hans.brattberg\" id=\"o.15\" title=\"Hans Brattberg\">Hans Brattberg</a> illustrated problems and possibilities with pair programming by actually playing a number of typcial scenarios. Nothing new here but great fun and a good reminder.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>After lunch I felt obliged to go enterprise. (Ok - I know I told everyone that I counted out all sessions mentioning enterprise and performance..... I&#39;m sorry - I let you down.) This was the talk about <a href=\"http://java.sun.com/javaee/\" id=\"v2jl\" title=\"Java EE 6\">Java EE 6</a> - a really good talk by Alexis Moussine-Pouchkine about a really boring subject. Seems like the new stuff in Java EE 6 is really nice and useful and will make life better for the developer. I don&#39;t particularly like the heavy use of annotations but it sure is powerful. The new Schedule annotation is still very verbose compared to a cron job definition but to be an enterprise solution is looks really smooth.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>To outweigh the bad influence of the enterprise I went to the <a href=\"http://jruby.org/\" id=\"f65.\" title=\"JRuby\">JRuby</a> session with <a href=\"http://blog.headius.com/\" id=\"czjs\" title=\"Charles Nutter\">Charles Nutter</a>. This was perhaps the best talk at jfokus this year. Entertaining and technically brilliant. The nicest part was how to transform a Java program to a Ruby one. A great way to show the unnecessary verbosity of Java. I knew most of the stuff in this talk since before but since I like ruby it was great anyway. As for the benefits of Ruby on the JVM I think it is a great selling point to enterprises that already invested in a J2EE infrastructure. No need to change that if you want to use Rails for you applications. (What they don&#39;t know is that it would probably be even easier to set up a pure Rails installation using apache....) Arguments for JRuby instead of standard Ruby is mostly around performance. For example - JRuby takes advantage of Javas threading model which makes it easier to scale an application. JRuby also runs faster in general. Another big selling point is access to Java libraries. I am not sure how often you really need something that is only Java but it may make lots of sense in a Java enterprise environment where other in-house apps and libraries are built with Java.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>I ended the conference with two fluffy lightning talks about feedback and leadership.

This made me late to the first tutorial. The first day of two is tutorial day - one before and one after lunch. 4 to choose from. I started with a nice talk on Good Object-Oriented Development by Kevlin Henney. Kevlin went through a lot of basic stuff related to object oriented development. Nothing new really but it is good to get this kind of confirmation know and then. He made some nice examples on encapsulation and showed us some real life code that was just not very good. I see similar stuff often in the systems I work with. One reason for this kind of code is that many developers learn a set of have-tos that they stick to. Some of them should probably be considered harmful. One example: always provide a default constructor. This may be useful if there is such thing as a default state for instances of the class but in many cases it results in objects with undefined state and leads to error prone code. Later on Kevlin removed &#39;get&#39; from some code with a bunch of getters and I felt like FINALLY. I have never understood the point with the <a href=\"http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/javabeans/index.jsp\">JavaBeans</a> standard (ok - tooling but what else?) getters and setters really suck. (Ruby has a much nicer way to go about it. No big surprise there.....) He also talked for a while about unit testing and a feeling I have had lately that writing tests per method is darn wrong was firmly confirmed. It is much better to name methods after what they test. A method is often tested with several test cases while other simpler methods can be tested indirectly without a dedicated test case. The readability of tests is often low and I know I have failed with this on several occasions but it is not hard to argue that test code should be as readable as the main code. It will all live for a while and it will all be maintained so it should all be in as good shape as possible.<br /><br />After lunch Anders Hammar delved into the depths of maven. Not the funniest subject but since I have some maven skills and don&#39;t work with it currently I felt that it was the best choice of the afternoon. (A kind of attempt to refresh a fading skill set.) Anders mixed slides and live demonstrations which is a very nice way to go about it. He started with lots of examples of the eclipse maven plugin m2eclipse. Looks really nice and I have tried it on a side project also. I didn&#39;t realize that m2eclipse runs on maven 3 but apparently it is compatible with maven 2 so you can use m2eclipse and maven 2 on the command line with the same configuration files. The part on dependency management didn&#39;t add anything new. More interesting then was the next part on life cycle customization. This is perhaps the area where maven has some serious problems. There are 3 built in lifecycles: default, clean and site. They are built up from phases where each phase has its default plugin that is executed. A problem with this is that this lifecycle view of a system build doesn&#39;t always fit all systems. If your plugin doesn&#39;t fit nicely into the phases you can run into all sorts of problems. A possiple way out of this problem is to <a href=\"http://www.sonatype.com/books/mvnref-book/reference/writing-plugins-sect-plugins-lifecycle.html\">create your own lifecycle</a>. I am not sure whether this is good or not. Maybe Hardy knows more about it? The tutorial was labelled &quot;advanced&quot; but to me it was closer to basics.

Even though it was not the first time we went there, it was the first time i really enjoyed it. Last time we went on a Sunday to visit the &quot;famous&quot; Feria de San Telmo. Then it was ways too many people and the whole thing was too touristy.<br />Today we went on a Satuerday and on top of that it was the 2nd day of Christmas. Some shops were still closed and there were just enough people around to create the right atmosphere. We ended up in the market hall of San Telmo. Even there the antiques stalls have almost taken over, but a considerable large part is still filled with fruit and vegetables stands.<br />There is something special about this places. No matter which city I visited, the markets are always a great place to hang out. Be it the Adelaide Market, Melbourne&#39;s Prahan Market, Göteborg&#39;s Saluhallen or in this case San Telmo&#39;s Market Hall - they were always good place for spending some peasureful hours. Today we ended up in a little cafe in the entrance of the hall and ended up staying several hours since Anna started to talk to one of the shop owners.

In my <a href=\"http://www.highlevelbits.com/2009/12/finding-apartment-in-buenos-aires.html\">previous post</a> I already talked about the rental costs and they are not really cheap. The good news is that the costs for having a coffee are very low. It normally costs around 6 <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=1+ARS+in+SEK\">ARS</a>. A sandwich with jamon y queso to go with the coffee should not cost more than 12 ARS. A softdrink (cola, mineral water, etc) is around 7 ARS. Of course this all depends a little on where you go :)<br />Another great thing is that public transportation is so cheap. There are two tariffs 1.20 and 1.25. If using a bus you just tell the driver where you want to go and then put the money into the machine behind the driver. The subway (Subte) is always 1.25. Compared to public transportation in Europe this is a real steal.<br />Last but not least, in case you are going to travel a lot by bus it is a good idea to buy a bus guide - <a href=\"http://www.guiat-digital.com.ar/\">guiat</a> which is available at newspaper stands.

We are here now for three weeks and lots has happened. The first challenge was to find a temporary (fully furnished) rental place. First the good news. There are plenty of apartments to choose from, so there is no need to panic. The bad news is that all real estate agents we met (and we met a few, believe me) tried to screw us. It surely felt this way. It is bad enough that foreigners have to pay in US Dollars what Argentinians have to pay in Argentinian Pesos. The least you could expect in return is some honest help. What we have experienced is that once you have signed a contract you fall on deaf ears when it comes to any problems. Nevertheless, here is a list of a websites you could check for apartments (no preferences):<br /><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.purabuenosaires.com.ar/\" id=\"nolm\" title=\"Pura Buenos Aires\">Pura Buenos Aires</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.casa34.com/\" id=\"ii_j\" title=\"Casa 34\">Casa 34</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rentalba.com.ar/\" id=\"j603\" title=\"Rental Argentina\">Rental Argentina</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.homeinargentina.com.ar/\" id=\"fqyg\" title=\"Home in Argentina\">Home in Argentina</a></li></ul><br />There are a few things you should watch out for though:<br /><ul><li>Always look at the apartment before singing anything. Pictures can be deceiving and you never know which major highway runs past just outside the apartment.</li><li>Ask if the advertised rental price includes the commission. If you rent via an agency expect a minimum commission of 20%. Often the commission is included, but we lost several hours with one agency which appeared to offer great value for money, only to realize that their price did not include their commission. To top things off this particular agency also wanted the the rent for the whole rental period <b>in cash</b> and <b>in advance</b>. Needless to say we walked straight out.</li><li>Make a list of things you are missing in the apartment or you want to get fixed. It is amazing how much these agencies will do <b>before</b> you signed and how <b>little</b> once you did.</li><li>Don\'t hesitate to negotiate the price. Given the amount of available apartments it is more than reasonable to ask for at least 100-200 USD discount, especially if you are staying for several months.<br /></li></ul><br />You probably ask yourself now what to do in order to avoid real estate agencies. Personally I would recommend renting directly from an owner. The best source to find direct rentals is via <a href=\"http://buenosaires.es.craigslist.org/\" id=\"qt.g\" title=\"craiglist\">craiglist</a>. The site\'s look&feel sucks and you have to get familiar with some Spanish terms, but it is worth the effort. Of course it also helps a lot if you are able to speak Spanish when calling up people, but I don\'t think is is absolutely necessary. <br /><br />Price wise expect to pay at least 1000-1300 USD for a reasonable place for two. Most apartments will fall into this price bracket, but what you then get for the money will differ enormously.<br /><br />Last, but not least <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gNTQyi15i0\" id=\"glr4\" title=\"here\">here</a> is a link to the place we ended up renting after a two weeks intermediate rental with Pura Buenos Aires.

I first started writing tests with the first version of Junit back in the late 90s. Back then I felt that this must surely be the way of the future. Not so. In every project I have worked in since I have had to fight to get people to even write unit tests. Per asks the question &quot;What do you think should go into an advanced class on TDD?&quot; The following are a couple of ideas from me.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>(1)</b> <b>How much</b> testing is good? Rare is the case when there are lots of tests that cover most of the system but for senior TDDers this may actually happen. In this rare moments it may be good to have some way of deciding on the correct amount of tests. If there are too much test code the cost of maintenance increases and it may be harder to change the test code than the production code. This leads me on to....</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>(2) Maintenance</b> of test code. Sometimes developers are somewhat disregarding towards their test code - &quot;it&#39;s only tests&quot;. This may lead to maintenance problems with the test code. If code is hard to read it is often thrown away and in the cases of tests often commented out or removed. I think that test code should be written with the same level of quality as the rest of the code.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>(3) Build integration</b>. Not all teams do continuos integration and even if they do developers arriving later to the code may not. If tests are not run at build time it is likely that they will stop compile after just a couple of months of nontesting. To avoid this - make sure that tests are always run when building. This is the case for anyone using maven but there are many homegrown ant solutions and if you are on something else than java it is a different story altogether.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>(4)</b> The <b>problems with test driven design</b>. One misconception that has sprung out from the XP movement (that they never advocated) is that code that is tested and refactored will inherently be of good design. Depending on the skill of your developers this may or may not happen. Just because we are agile doesn&#39;t mean that there isn&#39;t a need for design sketches. In XP this is called the system metaphor. Often this is forgotten in the agile mindset. An interesting subject is to do just enough designing and architecting up front.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>(5)</b> Per had a couple of interesting thoughts on <b>tests as specification</b>. I think this is a very important subject especially for teams without requirements documents. I think it is good to divide tests into unit tests and acceptance tests (or system tests or what you want to call them). Unit tests are developers tools to make sure they are done with their task. Acceptance tests on the other hand is the specification of how the system is supposed to work. I would like all unit tests to pass all the time and when they don&#39;t I want someone to drop everything else and fix it immediately. Acceptance tests on the other hand measure progress, when they all pass the iteration|sprint is finished. Acceptance tests test the system as a whole while unit tests test every part.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>(6)</b> The use of <b>simplicity</b> when coding unit tests. Often there is much effort to test classes in their entirety. Mocks, stubs and drivers are developed so that every unit can be fully tested. In many cases this is a really good thing but sometimes most of the code that really needs tests can be isolated in stand alone methods or functions and tested without setting up any complex surrounding. The surrounding will be tested by acceptance tests anyway.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>(7)</b> How to make developers <b>want to test</b>. The team I work with now got more enthusiastic about testing after installing the <a href=\"http://www.eclemma.org/\" id=\"a.ru\" title=\"Emma code coverage plugin for Eclipse\">Emma code coverage plugin for Eclipse</a>. Now they can see their progress in a neat way. The problem with this - of course - is that code coverage doesn&#39;t say that much about whether the tests are any good. Most developers know that you are supposed to write unit tests and they can probably argue about why as well. But when there is a bit pressure they feel that testing slows them down. This is largely a matter of habits. If you are unused to testing it makes you slower whereas when you use it all the time it actually makes you faster. Since this apparently is a case when logical arguments doesn&#39;t make it it would be interesting to hear about softer techniques for turning developers around.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>I have been thinking about writing some notes about TDD for a long time.

Except of the gained disk space and a slightly changed behavior of the dock items when you keep the mouse button pressed I actually haven\'t noticed anything outstanding yet.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there were a few things which needed additional care after the upgrade:<br /><ul><li>Java 5 is gone. Well, there is still a 1.5 symbolic link in <i>/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions</i>, but it just point to the 1.6 JDK. WTF? As Java developer I needed my JDK 5 back.

After the upgrade you have to completely replace your MacPorts installation :( The good news is that it is not too hard - see <a href=\"http://www.libertypages.com/clarktech/?p=743\">here</a>. MacPorts needs Xcode installed. Unfortunately, the upgrade removes the old version without replacing it with the new. Instead you have to insert the Snow Leopard CD again and install Xcode from the optional package directory on the CD.

One where the tests are run with the optional dependency on the classpath and one without.

Basically the talk was about why Java has overtaken C++ as the main programming language and a bit of speculation about the future. Maybe Scala is the next language?</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Linda Rising held a talk that was not directly related to IT and certainly could be applied to any discipline. Starting out in the industrial revolution and the introduction of clocks, schedules and plans to mankind she suggested that this may not be the ideal way of life. Until rather recently in the history of men it has been possible to sleep until waken. The physical clock of the body was the only one. Then factories appeared and with them a need to make sure that people worked a certain amount of time every day. We still live under this preposition whether or not it is a valid one. Around the same time as the industrial revolution caffeine came around. So in order to be alert enough to work the exact times that factories required we started to (ab)use this substance. Apparently we miss good research on what caffeine does to our body. We know that it inhibits our feeling of being tired. This could mean nothing or be a really bad thing. Linda showed pictures from an <a href=\"http://www.caffeineweb.com/?p=15\" id=\"uu3a\" title=\"experiment on spiders\">experiment on spiders</a> and their ability to make webs when influenced by different substances. Spiders high on marijuana actually performed better than the ones with caffeine.... Linda went on to talk about sleep patterns and the well-known 90 minute cycle. We probably need 5 such cycles a night and it is a good thing to wake up when a cycle just ended. When woken by the alarm bell the need for caffeine is naturally higher than woken naturally and thus we end up in a vicious circle. This can be extended to the daytime where cycles naturally also is important. 90 minutes work chunks might be a good idea and then breaking and perhaps even napping. Breaks with physical activity is preferable and what we naturally are disposed for. Several studies shows that taking a nap during the day increases our ability to learn. She referenced the pomodoro technique as one way of reaching this way of working. (I <a href=\"http://www.highlevelbits.com/2009/01/jfokus-summary.html\" id=\"u:f-\" title=\"wrote about\">wrote about</a> Staffan Nötebergs pomodoro tutorial at jfokus this year. Apparently there is a <a href=\"http://www.pomodoro-book.com/\" id=\"k0pk\" title=\"book\">book</a> coming out very soon.) All these things affects our productivity in the most profound way.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The talk &quot;Organizational Patterns and Scrum: Fine-tuning your Agile Implementation&quot; held by the couple Gertrud Bjørnvig &amp; Jim O. Coplien aka Cope started out with a little play involving people in the audience where proximity between different roles in a team illustrated different patterns. Cope then went on to talk about organizational patterns in relation to Scrum. I didn&#39;t know that the first incarnation of scrum actually was a pattern language. He related this to the pattern language he and some others have evolved and published in a nice book. This is indeed interesting stuff in times of naive simplicity and was a reminder to bring forth that book again. Surely there are things to learn and apply in my current context. Cope also mentioned that there will be a <a href=\"http://www.scrumplop.org/\" id=\"n2di\" title=\"ScrumPLoP conference\">ScrumPLoP conference</a> in Sweden next year.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Mary Poppendieck talked about &quot;Deliberate Practice in Software Development&quot; - a talk about expertise. She started out with looking at some other disciplines and related research that suggests that practicing makes an expert. Apparently some 10 years are needed to become an expert in a field given a continuos practicing during this time. There are 4 elements of deliberate practice: mentor, challenge, feedback and dedication. Mary then applied this to software development and noted that open source projects often offers an environment that fosters learning.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Lastly (cause I had a flight to catch, I missed the very last session) I listened to Richard Durnall from Thoughtworks. The first name today that I didn&#39;t recognize and a really interesting speaker. (Also nice slides.) The main thing Richard pointed out to me was that continuos and incremental improvement isn&#39;t always the right thing to do (a bit contrary to what Cope said earlier on). He illustrated this with a graph with Performance on the y axis and the choice we make to set up our organization on the x axis. If there is only one peak on this curve then incremental improvement will work perfectly. You change a little, measure performance to get the feedback if you are moving in the correct direction. If not - move in another direction. But consider the possibility that there are several peaks in productivity. Then incremental improvement may lead us to a lower peak although there are better performance peaks around. To avoid this problem consider a more radical change where the organization is thoroughly changed. Richard went on and compared 2 types of organizations, the standard command chain organization that is built inwards-out and the process organization that is built outwards from the needs of the customers and in. It took 5 years for Ford to discover that jeeps are not sold anymore. At Toyota however..... see rambling about Toyota below..... There are several benefits from process organizations but some of them comes with a bit of pain. Richard ended his presentation with this depressing quote by Konosuke Matsushita:&nbsp;</div><blockquote class=\"webkit-indent-blockquote\" style=\"margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none\">We are going to win and the industrial west is going to lose: there&rsquo;s nothing much you can do about it, because the reasons for your failure are within yourselves. Your ﬁrms are built on the Taylor model; even worse, so are your heads&hellip;.</blockquote><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Have you notices that Toyota is the new holy grail for methodists? Toyota works fine and is probably a great place to get inspiration from. But one thing that strikes me is that the software business doesn&#39;t seem able to come up with stuff of its own. We have the architecture analogy since way back and now we have a car dealer to draw from. Can it be that our discipline is too abstract to just talk about as is? Do we need clues from the &quot;real world&quot; to actually understand what we are doing? Probably nothing to be sad about but rather a sign of sanity!</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>This has been 3 great days with lots of interesting insights from lots of cool people. Going to conferences like JAOO is a great way of getting the feel for what is up and coming in the business. To my delight portals and portlets weren&#39;t mentioned a single time fueling my criticism of the project I work in currently. A bit surprising was the lack of an Erlang presentation - it seems like just as interesting a language as Clojure or Haskell. One thing I missed was more interaction. All sessions were mostly one way communication. There are several formats that can activate the audience but none of them were used. With this many developers around - wouldn&#39;t it be great with a hackathon for example? (I guess the pay extra tutorials are like this but....)</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>By the way - slides are available at the <a href=\"http://jaoo.dk/aarhus-2009/schedule/\" id=\"t6se\" title=\"conference site\">conference site</a>.

An interesting talk starting with an odyssey through the history of Enterprise Java. It is very interesting that J2EE was created by a bunch of companies that can benefit a lot from a complex approach. Rod called this &quot;the growth of the complexity industry&quot;. It not only includes evil big corporations that create standards for products they want to sell. It also includes architects benefitting from being one of a few that actually understands what is going on and developers aiming to get these complex technologies on their resumes. It is kind of a sad story. More recently it happened again with the SOA buzz. An important point though is that standards isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing. The standards forming J2EE is probably one important reason to why Java still is a choice for businesses. Without a formalized approach to the server side it is not hard to imagine an alternative road where Java would have been marginalized and we would have had a different landscape where probably Microsoft would have been a winner. All in all the talk was a really interesting retrospective with lots of hope in the future. There has never been a better time to be a developer than now.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Hardy made his talk on <a href=\"https://www.hibernate.org/410.html\" id=\"t3yc\" title=\"Hibernate Search\">Hibernate Search</a> and it has sharpened a lot since the first time I heard it and it was nice to see. The talk makes it painfully clear that doing full text search of things yourself is really not a good option. Hibernate Search takes care of all the infrastructural things you need when building search functionality on top of Hibernate ORM. Cool stuff.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Henrik Kniberg compared Kanban to Scrum in a good and useful way. His main point that there are different tools to use when setting up a software project and it depends what tool is appropriate for a certain project. If a project doesn&#39;t work it is not because the tool is bad - it is because the tool is badly used or because it is the wrong tool for the situation.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Kris Lander and Gus Power - No excuses : concept to cash every week.

It was an entertaining and opinionated talk with harsh comments about lots of things. For example what is the point of building big enterprise OO whatnot systems when most of them actually are simple CRUD systems? Isn&#39;t objects kind of overkill in all these cases? Or the joke about agile mentors: they are just unemployed smalltalk developers.

I realize that this man is quite a legend and it sure is an honor to listen to a man that has such huge experiences behind him. The rather fragmented talk was about the problems of scaling up agile methods. Again I sent a silent prayer to the gods that they may enlighten IT presenters in <a href=\"http://www.presentationzen.com/\" id=\"rh93\" title=\"presentation zen\">presentation zen</a>. Lots of strange graphs and tables in very small font made it hard to follow the talk. The question raised in the talk is definitely interesting. As project complexity increases in different directions the need for formality increases too. How do we address this? This need is different in different projects. One important thing to take into account is that the people making up a team and the organizations they belong to may be the biggest restriction on a project. The numbers of developers needed and their current skill set has a huge impact on a projects success. I never really got a good answer to the question from Barry but then I might have been a bit tired from the late flight yesterday.... The best answer I have seen yet is <a href=\"http://alistair.cockburn.us/\" id=\"og-o\" title=\"Alistair Cockburns\">Alistair Cockburns</a> work on <a href=\"http://alistair.cockburn.us/Crystal+methodologies+main+foyer\" id=\"rrjn\" title=\"the crystal method\">the crystal method</a> which sadly no one seems to be using. I would rather have seen crystal getting the position that Scrum has these days. Isn&#39;t it a bit typical that the lightweight method that focuses on management is the one that gets chosen when agile goes mainstream. What I miss A LOT in Scrum is the focus on the craftsmanship of coding that is emphasized in eXtreme Programming and in Crystal. With scrum it is perfectly valid to be agile without going test driven. The effects on the produced software unfortunately speaks for itself.</p><p>Michael Feathers had a really cool talk about working effectively with legacy code. I haven&#39;t read his book but I have followed his blog for a while and I really like his views on coding. We talk most about new code bases, new techniques etc and are not that interested in the old stuff that makes up the vast majority of the combined code bases. Yet this is the code that we probably will spend a lot of time changing and making right. The focus Feathers is putting on this subject is surely needed. I may blog a bit more about this talk later on when thoughts have settled.</p><div>(Legacy code always make me think of the <a href=\"http://www.laputan.org/mud/\" id=\"i11r\" title=\"big ball of mud\">big ball of mud</a> - true and ironic.)</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The creator, Rich Hickey, of the new programming language Clojure gave us an introduction to the language. It was truly refreshing to see this fundamentally different approach to languages as compared with Java/C#.

Lisp is very old yet one of the most elegant languages there is. Now I am not language guy so I will spare you a detailed description of Clojure. Instead - lets just say that it is functional, dynamically typed and compiled, highly concurrent and runs on top of the JVM. <a href=\"http://clojure.org/\" id=\"h11a\" title=\"Read more.....\">Read more.....</a></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>After lunch I made a bit of a mistake. Instead of listening to all sorts of interesting talks I decided to give the semantic web a second chance. Not that the talks were any bad - it is just that I have been hoping for change in this area for some time and it never really seems to take off. First out was Brian McBride with a talk called Linked data and after him Eric Gordon Prud&#39;hommeaux with a talk called the Semantic web. Both talks were a bit too technical and failed to communicate the vision of the semantic web to me. (Admittedly I was a bit tired after lunch and not enough sleep.) I have been really curious about where the efforts around the semantic web will lead us and so far the answer seems to be nowhere. Brian said something about the impossible task of creating an upfront model for the semantic web and that it rather is something that will grow over the years. Different concrete applications will arise and drive its acceptance further. I agree that this is the only way forward but it makes me a bit sad since it probably means that it will never come to areas where there are no competitive advantage of embracing it.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Hardy arrived and he really wanted to see the legendary Barry Boehm so since I didn&#39;t have a good alternative to come up with I accompanied him to that lecture which essentially was a replay of the keynote.

It became quite quickly clear to me that Mac uses a different approach for service configuration.<br /><br />A search on the internet first led me down the path of <a href=\"http://macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2003/10/21/startup.html\">StartupItems</a>, but some more research showed the better way of doing this is to use the services of the <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/macosx/launchd.html\">launchd</a> deamon. The are system and user specific services, configured in <i>/System/Library/LaunchAgents</i> and <i>~/System/Library/LaunchAgents</i> respectively. The configuration uses Mac&#39;s plist xml format. Since I am not really used to these plist files I had a quick check on the net. surely there must be some sort of frontend to this. And yes, there is - <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/lingon/files/\">Lingon</a>. I am not sure how active development is on this project, but the version I downloaded did everything I wanted. The interface it quite intuitive, so there is no point to go into too much detail. Instead here comes the plist file Lingon created to for me to run Tomcat as service:</p>

The venue was <a href=\"http://www.piperskamuren.se/\" id=\"dim4\" title=\"piperska muren\">piperska muren</a> - a really nice conference centre at Kungsholmen. The founder of the company opened up with a short introduction of the agenda, the company and the speakers.&nbsp;</p><p>First out was <a href=\"http://olabini.com/\" id=\"qlww\" title=\"Ola Bini\">Ola Bini</a> - one of the local employees - speaking - as he often does - about programming languages. He made some points about the usefulness of different languages - most of them valid I think. A typical application today uses a bunch of languages - think enterprise Java and you have at least Java, XML, HTML, CSS, Javascript and SQL. It is one language per technical need. So we are sort of used to different languages already. What we are not used to are different main programming languages. A system may be written using a bunch of different languages for its subsystems depending on the character of each subsystem. Coding a rules engine in Java may not be the best choice of language for example. I agree a lot with this. I would rather try new languages every year then continue to dwell in the Java trench. It would probably be good for the systems I work on and I would grow personally a lot more than I do now (repeating the same tedious tasks over and over). But I am not so sure this is a practical approach. The proportion of developers that are able to easily grasp another programming language is very low. Many developers I work with barely manages to get it right in Java but when they finally &quot;get&quot; it - it sticks. Is it possible to deploy a large number of languages in a large organization that &quot;just&quot; have average developers? I would like to say yes to this but I am not so sure.</p><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Second - <a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/\" id=\"hz03\" title=\"Martin Fowler\">Martin Fowler</a>. A great speaker to say the least. He held 3 different short talks. (1) First he talked about the value of software design. He made a lot of good and well known points. Software design is not visible to the users and customer of a system so it is not easy to make them pay for good software design. The way to go about it is to introduce the concept of technical debt (coined by Ward Cunningham) to the customer. Whenever there is a technical debt the customer can either decide to pay the debt up front (refactor the system) or pay interest on future investments (added functionality needs to live with and work around &nbsp;limitations introduced earlier). And as interest builds up new functionality gets more and more expensive. He also did not agree on the difference between technical debt and mess <a href=\"http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2009/09/22/a-mess-is-not-a-technical-debt\" id=\"dp07\" title=\"as described in a blog post by Uncle Bob\">as described in a blog post by Uncle Bob</a> but rather thought of it in matters of whether the debt was deliberately created or not. Fowlers nondeliberate debt probably equals Uncle Bobs mess. A debt is always created in any software project since we can not know the design until after we are done. Software development is exploratory in its nature and it is natural that knowledge about the system comes to us progressively throughout a project. A comforting thought indeed. (2) The second talk was a proposal to use the <a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html\" id=\"x.0e\" title=\"pattern event sourcing\">pattern called &quot;event sourcing&quot;</a>&nbsp;more in business applications. He argued that this concept - that developers use everyday while using version control systems makes a lot of sense in many business situations too. It solves the problems of history and alternative reality (branching) for us. Interesting but not applicable right now.... (3) In the third talk he took a step back and pondered on the nature of software projects and related it to the work of thoughtworks. There is a scale of software efforts from pure infrastructure of no competitive business value to core business software that may be the edge between a business and its competitors. A competitive and therefore expensive software consultancy like thoughtworks should look for the latter kind of projects - strategic projects where the payback is far higher then the increased cost of skilled developers. In these kind of projects there is a real point in using expensive and great developers. He finished of with a bit of self criticism wanting his company to work less with &quot;crappy financial software&quot; and more with stuff that makes the world a better place.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Third and last - <a href=\"http://blog.vivekprahlad.com/\" id=\"uxvu\" title=\"Vivek Prahlad\">Vivek Prahlad</a> - one of the men behind <a href=\"http://studios.thoughtworks.com/agile-test-automation\" id=\"t10z\" title=\"Twist\">Twist</a> - thoughtworks automatic gui tester that also comes bundled with the continours integration tool Cruise (a commercial continuation of CruiseControl) and collaboration thing Mingle. He started with laying the theoretical foundation for this kind of testing. This includes the case against manual testing due to its inability to repeat the same test twice and that test is an issue for the entire team - not only for the testers. All this seems so nice and good but is seldom implemented for real. He then went on and demonstrated Twist and I must say that I was truly impressed. Too bad it ain&#39;t free - I want to implement it right away in my current project. At $3000 a year for 5 users it is still not expensive but harder to just slip into an organization where the procurement process is sacred. I will certainly recommend it to any future customer. Twist runs on top of selenium (and other test automation frameworks as well I think) and enables test cases that actually are readable by normal users. Built in the eclipse framework it features refactoring of test cases among other things. The generated code is easily accessible so that code generated by the recorder can be made tidy.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>All in all - a nice couple of hours listening to people that knows software development.</div><br /><br /><br />","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 274,"revision_id": 274,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "<p>I got the task to migrate all our code - some 100 classes - from standard <a href=\"http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/index.html?java/util/logging/package-summary.html\">JDK logging</a> to the logging facade framework <a href=\"http://www.slf4j.org/\">slf4j</a>.

My latest frustration is with the new payment system of <a href=\"http://www.vasttrafik.se/sv/\">Västtrafik</a> (Göteborg&#39;s tram and bus operator). Initially I thought it&#39;s just me, but the new ticket system has gotten quite some press over the past few weeks. Well, at least here in Göteborg. I am sure a &quot;Stockholmare&quot; couldn&#39;t care less ;-)<br /><br />Funny enough the people in charge at Västtrafik went from denying any problems to admitting errors to extending the grace period of the old system. In my opinion there are several issues with the new system. I don&#39;t mind that there is a deposit on the new re-chargeable travel card (other people seem to have a big issue with that). I am more concerned about that even the tram and bus drivers cannot explain the new system. And believe me - I don&#39;t blame them. Here is a picture of the new system installed on all trams and buses. WTF?</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_large\",\"fid\":\"108\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"class\":\"media-image\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\"}}]]</p><p>A yellow box with the symbols &#39;+&#39;, &#39;T&#39;,&nbsp; &#39;V&#39;, &#39;S&#39;, &#39;?&#39;, &#39;Å&#39;, &#39;K&#39;. I don&#39;t get it. And is there some grouping of the buttons implied? Or was it just the easiest way to wire this yellow monster up?<br />Registering a simple single trip is admittedly quite simple. Just hold your card into the center of the machine. Pretty obvious, no? There is a big hand holding a card. I call this a good visual cue. But what if I want to travel multiple zones, or if I want to pay for a friend? Hmm, maybe I press the &#39;?&#39;. That could be the help system, right? Nope :( So is it the &#39;+&#39; to pay for two? I am thinking adding another person. Nope. That&#39;s for adding zones. But hey, why is that a &#39;+&#39; and not a &#39;Z&#39; for zone. To add another person you have to press &#39;V&#39; like vuxen (adult). So what do all the other letters stand for. To be honest I still don&#39;t know.<br /><br />Västtrafik paid millions for this system and was years behind in introducing it and this is all they can come up with? Personally I would fire the person in charge! At the very least I would force him to read Garr Reynolds <a href=\"http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/\">Presentation Zen</a> blog. I am sure he could learn some valuable lessons there. Especially that design matters. This might also stop him from saying things like:&quot;Jag var själf med i en referensgrupp för utprovningen och jag upplevde det som enkelt. Systemet är pedagogiskt och enkelt att lära sig&quot; (I myself was&nbsp; in an evaluation group and I experienced the system as easy. It is pedagogic and easy to learn). What a joke. I am sure Västtrafik&#39;s passengers would have been much more easy going with the new system if it would have been easier to understand.<br /><br />Here a a few ideas. Replace or add images to the buttons. Come up with some decent visual cues. Also think about foreigners. How would they ever what these letters stand for. Another idea could be to replace the display with a bigger one which allows to display some more help text. And if everything fails put big signs next to the machine. And for heavens sake, take responsibility and admit that you screwed up.<br /><br />--Hardy</p>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 278,"revision_id": 278,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "<div><a href=\"http://highlevelbits-ferentschik.rhcloud.com/sites/default/files/sites/default/files/images\" id=\"rwf5\" title=\"Peter Svensson\">Peter Svensson</a> showing us the really cool Google technologies <a href=\"https://wave.google.com/\" id=\"lyha\" title=\"Wave\">Wave</a> and <a href=\"http://www.android.com/\" id=\"arib\" title=\"Android\">Android</a>.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Google Wave is really an interesting concept.

For the real data nerds I tracked the whole trip using my GPS. The route contains the track from Nikkalukta to the Fjällstation as well as the western route up to Kebnekaise. I marked our camp spots and some other points of interests. You can download the gpx file <a href=\"http://ferentschik.de/download/Kebnekaise-2009.GPX\" id=\"rm-j\" title=\"here\">here</a>. As far as I could find out I am there first to <i>release</i> the western route track in a GPS consumable format :)<br /><br />Regarding the packing we stuck with the packing list found on <a href=\"http://www.kebnekaise.nu/se/utrustning/packlista.php\" id=\"e0x8\" title=\"kebnekaise.nu\">kebnekaise.nu</a> and I must say it served us well. Well done!<br /><br />A word about the food. We decided against all these freeze tried hiking foods. They may have a purpose if you climb the Mount Everest, but when walking in the Swedish Fjällen they are just stupid and face it - most of them taste crap. Instead we packed some packages of rice and noodles, some tuna cans most importantly some fresh stuff like aubergines, zucchini and capsicum. Boil some rice, add some chopped veggies and tuna and off you go. Depending on the time of the year you can even pep up your food with some picked mushrooms or berries (we saw a quite a lot of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudberry\" id=\"mf03\" title=\"cloudberries\">cloudberries</a>, but unfortunately they were not ripe yet).<br /><br />I also would like to congratulation the team of the Kebnekaise Fjällstation. It is one of the best run <a href=\"http://www.stfturist.se/\" id=\"x1:l\" title=\"STF\">STF</a> hostels I have seen so far. I think other hostel owners should plan a trip up there themselves and learn!<br /><br />--Hardy","body_summary": null,"body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 280,"revision_id": 280,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "<p>So - we made it home after 3 weeks in mostly France. A great trip with many memorable moments. There are some great benefits with bringing your own car. It is much easier to improvise and it is possible to bring home bottles of strong liquid. In Provence we picked a winemaker by chance while driving on small inland roads. They let us taste several kinds of vin rouge and we ended up buying 2x6 bottles that are now safely stored in our basement.<br /><br />We started our trip with a couple of days in Bruges - once the main trading town in north western Europe. Nowadays it is a very nice and lively city to stroll around in with many old houses and canals. And great beer. Every place has a couple of great beers on tap. Compare that to Sweden where we have to del with Spendrups and Pripps on tap - ouch. The food was good - the best place we ate at was <a href=\"http://www.devlaamschepot.be/en/index2.htm\">De Vlaamsche Pot</a> with traditional flemish cuisine. Highly recommended. On our way towards France we stopped at the trappist monastery of Westvlateren and had great lunch with even greater beer. The shop had run out of it unfortunatley so we couldn&#39;t bring any home.<br /><br />Next Paris. Me and Käthe met with my kids there and then we made all the touristy things: Disneyland, Louvres, Tour Eiffel, Champs Elysees, boat trip on Seine, a glimpse of Tour de France, Montmartre etc. We also visited the great impressionist Musee d&#39;Orsay. A great couple of days with some really nice food experiences as well. One lunch at <a href=\"http://www.relaisentrecote.fr/\">Relais de l&#39;Entrecote</a> on 15 rue Marbeuf close to elysees where they only serve heavenly entrecote with frites. Great vin de pays to go with it. The place to visit if you are really hungry.

We stayed a couple of nights at the charming <a href=\"http://www.hotel-saint-etienne.com/anglais/hotel-st-etienneGB.htm\">Hotêl St Etienne</a> in Caen. This one star hotel was the cheapest and best we stayed at and the only one that came with free wireless. We made a couple of daytrips from Caen to the d-day beaches and cemetaries and to the nice monastery island Mont St Michel. The outstanding l&#39;Embroche on 17 Rue Porte au Berger served the best meal of the entire vacation.

On our way there we stopped at hotels in Poitiers and Le Puy-en-Velay. Outside of Poitiers the very french theme park Futuroscope was a nice experience with a very amazing laser show at nightfall. In Le Puy-en-Velay we had great salads at le Croco on 5 Rue Chaussade and an awesome local beer called Villavia. Le puy is a great old town with a cathedral, monastery and red mary statue at the hill and cliff in the midst of the town.

We made one daytrip to Avignon to visit the papal palaces - really nice. And then we headed home via Italy and the alps. It is amazing that you get great food even at the rest stops in italy. We had great Pasta di Liguria on our way home and we made sure to stop one last time before the swiss border to have a decent espresso. The road through the alps were astonishing - no pics taken though. The last day we managed to drive from Ulm in southern Germany all the way home - some 1600 kms.<br /><br />More pics are available in <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/froderik/sets/72157621902465519/\">this set</a> at flickr.

This time I want to blog about another area of software development where frustration is running high - XML processing. On the surface things looks easy, but who does not remember the classpath problems around XML parsing in the early days (SAX vs XERCES vs DOM, etc). And who really fully understands the XSD syntax and is able to create a properly designed xsd? And documentation - let&#39;s just not talk about it!<br /><br />But let&#39;s get to the actual problem. I wanted to use <a href=\"https://jaxb.dev.java.net/\">JAXB</a> to write a parser for XML files matching a given xsd. Given that Sun introduced JAXB as official XML binding framework for Java it seems the obvious choice for the task. Unfortunately, another requirement was that the code would work under JDK 5 and 6. However, the JAXB API is only offical part of the JDK since version 6. To solve this problem a little trick is needed. Let&#39;s take it step by step using <a href=\"http://maven.apache.org/\">Maven</a> as build system. First we have to include the <a href=\"http://mojo.codehaus.org/jaxb2-maven-plugin/\">plugin</a> by adding the following to the <a href=\"http://maven.apache.org/pom.html\">POM</a>:</p>
<pre class=\"brush: xml\">
&lt;plugin&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.codehaus.mojo&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;jaxb2-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;executions&gt;
        &lt;execution&gt;
            &lt;goals&gt;
                &lt;goal&gt;xjc&lt;/goal&gt;
            &lt;/goals&gt;
        &lt;/execution&gt;
    &lt;/executions&gt;
    &lt;configuration&gt;
        &lt;packageName&gt;org.hibernate.validation.xml&lt;/packageName&gt;
        &lt;outputDirectory&gt;${basedir}/target/generated-sources&lt;/outputDirectory&gt;
        &lt;extension&gt;true&lt;/extension&gt;
    &lt;/configuration&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;
</pre>
<p>The task of the plugin is to create the Java binding classes for the xsd. Per default the xsd file has to be placed into the directory <i>/src/main/xsd</i>. The configuration in the POM specifies the default package name for the generated classes and in which directory the classes have to be generated. The meaning of <i>extension </i>we will discuss a little later.<br /><br />The setup so far will work fine with JDK 6, but in order to make it work for JDK 5 as well we have to use profiles. The idea is to add the required libraries which are missing in JDK 5 depending on the JDK version. This can be achieved by adding the following to the POM:</p>
<pre class=\"brush: xml\">
&lt;profiles&gt;
        &lt;profile&gt;
            &lt;id&gt;jaxb&lt;/id&gt;
            &lt;activation&gt;
                &lt;jdk&gt;1.5&lt;/jdk&gt;
            &lt;/activation&gt;
            &lt;dependencies&gt;
                &lt;dependency&gt;
                    &lt;groupId&gt;javax.xml.bind&lt;/groupId&gt;
                    &lt;artifactId&gt;jaxb-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;
                    &lt;version&gt;2.1&lt;/version&gt;
                &lt;/dependency&gt;
                &lt;dependency&gt;
                    &lt;groupId&gt;com.sun.xml.bind&lt;/groupId&gt;
                    &lt;artifactId&gt;jaxb-impl&lt;/artifactId&gt;
                    &lt;version&gt;2.1.3&lt;/version&gt;
                &lt;/dependency&gt;
            &lt;/dependencies&gt;
        &lt;/profile&gt;
&lt;/profiles&gt; 
</pre>
<p>So far things were quite simple to figure out. The hard part is one more requirement I haven&#39;t mentioned yet. The parser should be tolerant against whitespaces. Some googling and I figured out that in JAXB this kind of things are done with adapters. In fact the <i>CollapsedStringAdapter</i> seems to be exactly what I want. The javadoc says:&quot;This adapter removes leading and trailing whitespaces, then truncate any sequnce of tab, CR, LF, and SP by a single whitespace character &#39;&quot;. Great, but how do I configure JAXB so that it automatically uses this adapter. Here the frustration really starts. The best a search for <i>CollapsedStringAdapter </i>results in is the javadoc for this class. Nothing about how to use it. Not in plain JAXB nor in conjunction with the maven plugin. Frustration started to mount again. To cut a long story short. It took many mailing list posts and a lot of try and error to figure it out. The outcome is that first of all you need the <i><extension>true</extension></i> bit in the plugin configuration. Next you have to create a file called <i>binding-customization.xjb </i>in <i>src/main/xjb</i>. The file has to contain the following:</p>
<pre class=\"brush: xml\">
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;jxb:bindings version=&quot;1.0&quot; xmlns:jxb=&quot;http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/jaxb&quot;
    xmlns:xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; xmlns:xjc=&quot;http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/jaxb/xjc&quot;&gt;
    &lt;jxb:bindings schemaLocation=&quot;../xsd/validation-mapping-1.0.xsd&quot; node=&quot;/xs:schema&quot;&gt;
        &lt;jxb:globalBindings&gt;
            &lt;xjc:javaType name=&quot;java.lang.String&quot; xmlType=&quot;xs:string&quot; 
                adapter=&quot;javax.xml.bind.annotation.adapters.CollapsedStringAdapter&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/jxb:globalBindings&gt;
    &lt;/jxb:bindings&gt;
&lt;/jxb:bindings&gt;
</pre>
<p>In the customization file a global binding gets defined for all <i>java.lang.String</i> types. It looks simple, but believe me it was damn hard to figure out. Hopefully this blog will save someone the painful hours I had.</p><p><br />My personal conclusion was that documetnation around XML related topics still sucks :(<br /><br />--Hardy</p>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 282,"revision_id": 282,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "<p>After too much time wrestling with setting up a two way SSL connection between one WebLogic Server 10 instance and one WebLogic Server 9 instance through one Apache instance I have now come to a solution. I don&#39;t know much about these matters. In the 12 years I have spent in the business I have only worked with issues like these once before. And it seems that not many people know about how to solve it. I asked everyone I could think of in the organisation and finally I found <a href=\"http://www.sensate.se\" id=\"scod\" title=\"Rickard Lundin\">Rickard Lundin</a> that was the first person that actually seemed to understand the whole chain of events. So with Rickards help and with a lot of help from <a href=\"http://www.google.com\" id=\"n6.3\" title=\"Google\">Google</a> a solution is now at hand.<br /><br />The solution we found was rather simple and it is kind of disturbing that it took so long. I spent several hours in the console of WebLogic Server where there are one tab for SSL and one for Keystores for every server instance in a domain. This didn&#39;t work at all and one WLS expert I talked to said he never got it to work properly. This may still not be the case but I can tell you that it sure is not easy to make it work. So scrap WLS configurations. Instead what to do is rely on Javas built in support for SSL and HTTPS. Whenever instances of java.net.URL gets called with openConnection() and the protocol https is used in the url there are 4 system properties that are used. (For older versions of Java you may need to install JSSE specifically to make this work.) These are <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">javax.net.ssl.keyStore</span> and <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword</span> for the key and certificate you want to use to certify your client. And then there is <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">javax.net.ssl.trustStore </span>and <span style=\"font-family: Courier New;\">javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword</span> that is used to to make sure that the client can trust the server it is calling. Both &quot;store&quot;-properties must point to a file stored in JKS (Java KeyStore) format. And the password parameters are naturally used to access those key stores. If you have pem files or some other kind of file format for you keys and certs you can use the open source tool <a href=\"http://portecle.sourceforge.net/\" id=\"dc:l\" title=\"Portecle\">Portecle</a> to put them into a JKS file instead. There is also the <a href=\"http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/windows/keytool.html\" id=\"fqeb\" title=\"keytool tool\">keytool tool</a> (!) in JDK that knows a lot about how to maniuplate JKS files. And more generic perhaps - <a href=\"http://www.openssl.org/\" id=\"wpju\" title=\"openssl\">openssl</a> on the command line.<br /><br />A <a href=\"http://jcalcote.wordpress.com/2008/11/13/java-secure-http-keys/\" id=\"cl:t\" title=\"very good post\">very good post</a> about this.<br /><br />In my case I needed to make 2 calls to the server - the first one to get a login and a session and the second to get some data. This is hard with the normal JDK classes so I downloaded <a href=\"http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/index.html\" id=\"x59x\" title=\"httpclient\">httpclient</a> 3.1 (version 4 is in beta) and used the classes HttpClient and GetMethod to do my calls. The session still wasn&#39;t kept alive between the calls. Some more googling led me to the documentation <a href=\"http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/cookies.html\" id=\"v6w4\" title=\"about cookies\">about cookies</a> (!) at httpclient home page. And it makes sense since the web server store the session identity as a cookie. No need to rewrite the session id when calling from a controlled environment. It turned out that the code</p>
<pre>
 method.getParams().setCookiePolicy(CookiePolicy.RFC_2109)</pre>
<p>made wonders when put in between creating the method object and executing it. So a couple of system properties and about 10 lines of code solved this problem. It is so easy to get lost in the app server jungle when there often is a simpler solution close by. And this solution works from a standalone client too!<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 283,"revision_id": 283,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "<p>I started writing this post quite a while ago and now stumbled across it. Seems like it deserves publishing.... and an ending!<br /><br />I have always been a bit disturbed about that we use <i>architecture</i> as the one and only metaphor for software development. Originally it was thought that building software was somewhat similar to building houses. Most people nowadays realize that this is not the case. The word architecture has gained a meaning of its own when used in the system development context. It is essentially useless to try to change it. We have to accept it and use the metaphor whenever we speak of the structure and subdivision of a software system. (Which also means that I have to accept the title &quot;software architect&quot; when being the person that makes decisions about the structure of a software system. Well, well - with great titles come great powers and sometimes a bit of reward.) It is nevertheless refreshing to think in other ways occasionally and this post is about software development as mapping.</p><div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>I was happy to - yet again - read a brilliant <a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/\" id=\"x03y\" title=\"a list apart\">a list apart</a> article somewhat related to this issue. At least it made me start thinking about it again. The article is called <a href=\"http://alistapart.com/articles/mappingmemory\" id=\"rmay\" title=\"Mapping Memory : Web Designer as Information Cartographer\">Mapping Memory : Web Designer as Information Cartographer</a> and is written by Aaron Rester. He makes the case that instead of thinking about web design as information architecture - we should think about it as cartography - providing maps for the user. Listen:<br /><blockquote>I suggest, therefore, that the art of cartography might fruitfully be used alongside architecture. This might sound like an odd suggestion, since at first glance, cartography appears to be nearly the opposite of architecture. Common sense tells us that an architect begins with an abstraction&mdash;a blueprint&mdash;and creates from that abstraction a concrete structure existing in physical space. The cartographer, on the other hand, starts with concrete structures existing in physical space and creates from that an abstraction: a map.</blockquote></div><div>Now I think that this is valid also for system architecture. A software system is - in the end (believe it or not) - built for its users and they often need a map or a mental model to safely navigate the system. But what is this map really?<br /><br />My experience is that a system architecture should be as close a resemblance of the users real world as possible. There are things that are core to the users - these things may be written in stone throughout the system. A word processing system shouldn&#39;t lack a document object - paragraphs, chapters, words and letters are core to the system. These concepts should be in the midst of the map.<br /><br />Sometimes it can even be used as the tool for changing the users real world. If a business wants to head in a certain direction its software can be used to redraw the map. Most important in this case is the visual structure that Aaron Rester is talking about but underneath there is another structure that needs to be in sync. If the system behaves contrary to the experienced map the user will be confused and will think about the system as a magic artifact. It is possible to think of different kind of maps. A surface map that is what Aaron writes about and a infrastructure map that also explains the inner workings of the system.<br /><br />Some things that I do when creating a system architecture:<br /><ul><li>Treat the business map and the software map as one and the same.</li><li>The software map might describe things that are invisible to the user. The degree of &quot;invisible&quot; things is a measure of complexity.</li><li>Introduce abstractions that are useful for the user. (And hide abstractions that confuses.)</li><li>Ask visionaries about the future. Can the software map guide the user though the next busines development?</li><li>Question any architectural elements that does not enhance the user. Remove them from the map.</li></ul></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>All this thinking about mapping led me way back to the <a href=\"http://the-programmers-stone.com/\" id=\"t9ei\" title=\"programmers stone\">programmers stone</a>. A very long time ago I read the <a href=\"http://the-programmers-stone.com/the-original-talks/\" id=\"jrgi\" title=\"original talks\">original talks</a> and being rather new to the business they helped increase my understanding of the strange organisation I worked in then. It was initially hard to accept that software was deemed good once it worked regardless of the inside quality. The stone helped me grasp that different kinds of persons have different kinds of outlooks on this matter. It introduced the rather simplistic notion of mappers and packers as a way of grouping people. Programmers (at least good ones) are mappers - they understand a problem domain and draw a map that is useful in software construction. A mapper knows how to organize a domain. Other people are mostly packers. They don&#39;t know how to organize a domain but are instead rather big on particulars. Listen to this part from <a href=\"http://the-programmers-stone.com/the-original-talks/day-1-thinking-about-thinking/\" id=\"du7f\" title=\"thinking about thinking\">thinking about thinking</a>:<br /><br /><div><blockquote>To understand what programmers really do, an alternative strategy of thinking (called mapping) is necessary, because programming is essentially a process of internalising the capabilities of the system, the nature of the problem, and the desire, and capturing the insight in a programming language. It is all about exploring the details of our desires, and understanding them in such a way that we can keep track of all the complexity. Mapper problem collapse can produce beautiful, tiny, elegant programs with no room for bugs in them. Mapping can do programming, but how it does it cannot be explained in packer,<br />action-based language.</blockquote></div><br />I hope this quote got you started. Read the whole thing when you have a couple of hours to spend!<br /><br />To sum things up - I truly believe that we - system architects - are in deep need of other analogies than &quot;architecture&quot; and we need to think more about what we do. Mapping is one way to look at things but there are surely other ways too.</div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 284,"revision_id": 284,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "<p>It is time to get more technical again. This time I want to write about cloud computing or more specifically about <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/\">Amazon&#39;s EC2</a>. Given the hype around the very hard to define term of cloud computing, it was for a long time on my todo list to check EC2 out. However, I wanted to have a use case. &quot;Luckily&quot; I had to fix a Hibernate Search <a href=\"http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/HSEARCH-248\">bug</a> which would only manifest itself against a certain set of databases, including SQLServer. Since I did not have a SQLServer running locally, I decided this might be the opportunity I was looking for. Surely, there must be a virtual machine in EC2 with SQLServer installed.<br /><br />Turns out there are heaps and it is a piece of cake to get started. All you need is an amazon account. If you ever ordered a book from Amazon chances are you have one. It felt a little wrong to use it though. I still have to associate Amazon to more than just a bookstore. Anyways, logging in worked fine and after answering some initial setup questions, generating a certificate for authentication and watching a 3 minutes tutorial video, you are ready to proceed to the EC2 console. Just press the Launch Instance button, select a virtual machine configuration and off you go. It is all very intuitive and easy to understand (meaning no need for reading any more documentation:). The actual starting up time for the virtual machine was longer than I expected and I started to think something went wrong, but in the end the console reported the machine ready to use. Once running, you have a public DNS name for the machine which you can use to connect to it via ssh or remote desktop. Again very simple.<br />In my case I just used remote desktop to log onto the machine, create a new SQLServer database to use for running my tests and then I was back debugging my problem. Sweet.<br /><br />I haven&#39;t tried yet any of the other EC2 services like volumes and snapshots, but I will be back.

I did - very impressive.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_large\",\"fid\":\"109\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"class\":\"media-image\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\"}}]]</p><p><br /><br />Navigating the island is, however, quite hard. Cretans seem to be unable to decide<br />how to spell city names and instead just alternate spellings, for example Chania, Hania and Xania. All the same and this is a simple example! Throw longer names and the Greek alphabet into the mix and you can quickly get lost. However, my pattern matching skills came in handy. As soon as two different spellings had a similar amount of characters and at least three or four matched I concluded I am on the right way :)<br /><br />On top of the navigational problems there seem to be no traffic rules on Crete. At least not ones anyone adheres to. You see 50 km/h speed limit signs at the entrance of villages, but 80 km/h was the rule. Maybe 50 is the minimum speed limit? Shoulder lanes also serve a different purpose on Crete. Anyone slower than 80 km/h &#39;has&#39; to be on the shoulder lane, so that other cars can dangerously overtake while completely ignoring oncoming traffic. Not using the shoulder lane in this way can lead to quite aggressive driving of cars behind you. All this said, it only took me a couple of hours to adopt the wreck-less driving rules and feel like a true Cretan :) Let&#39;s hope I can adjust as quickly back to the Swedish <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagom\">lagom</a> way of driving.<br /><br />During our stay we visited two different ecotourism places. First <a href=\"http://www.milia.gr/english.html\">Milia</a> on the western part of the island<br />&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_large\",\"fid\":\"110\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"class\":\"media-image\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\"}}]]</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_large\",\"fid\":\"111\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"class\":\"media-image\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\"}}]]</p><p><br />and then then in <a href=\"http://www.asprospotamos.com/eng/main.html\">Aspros Potamos</a> on the eastern part.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_large\",\"fid\":\"112\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"class\":\"media-image\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\"}}]]</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_large\",\"fid\":\"113\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"class\":\"media-image\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\"}}]]</p><p><br />Both places are very nice, but I was most impressed by the first. Not so much because of the accommodation, but more because of the food. In fact I had to change my whole attitude towards Greek food. So far it ranked somewhere after the Italian and Spanish cuisine. But there is more to Greek food than Slouvaki and Moussaka and the so called Greek restaurants I have visited here in Sweden are just a shadow of what I tasted on Crete. The traverna in Milia is especially known to only serve fresh local produce and most is even cultivated on the property. And believe me - you can taste it! My mouth is still watering just thinking about the food at this place.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /><br />[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_large\",\"fid\":\"114\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"class\":\"media-image\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\"}}]]</p><p>Do get rid of some of the excess calories we also did some hiking on the island, for example in the Polyrinnia Gorge. At this time of the year it was very beautiful with all sort of wild flowers blooming. I must say, the island is much greener than I expected. Of course the hiking was combined with some <a href=\"http://www.geocaching.com/\">geocaching</a> as well. I am finally drawing close to my 100th geocache (I know you lead is uncatchable, Fredrik ;-)<br /><br />Overall it was a beautiful week on Crete. Away from rainy Sweden and away from technology. Have I mentioned that none of the places we stayed had Internet. Not even electricity! In return I had over 1000 unread emails and almost 500 unviewed RSS items. Well, I must admit I applied a quite aggressive skim and delete algorithm to get through things ;-)<br /><br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />P.S. Thanks for the pictures goes to Anna.

But the magic date is 1st of April. Suddenly you see outdoor chairs, tables and terraces popping up everywhere. However, even spring has certainly arrived by April, the weather can still be quite cold and chilly. That cannot stop a true Swede. As long as there is a glimpse of sun shine everyone will flock to the <i>uteserveringar. </i>See and be seen!

I started out using <a href=\"http://www.junit.org/\" id=\"cnko\" title=\"Junit 4\">Junit 4</a>  for unit tests.  However, in order to leverage from some other framework I had to switch to <a href=\"http://testng.org/\" id=\"m3yl\" title=\"TestNG\">TestNG</a>. I thought it should be quite easy to change from one framework to the other - basically just switch the import statements. Turns out is was more difficult than that. After a global find and replace in the test files replacing the package statement I ended up with multiple compilation errors. The problem was that in Junit the assertEquals method has the signature <i>assertEquals(String message, Object expected, Object actual)</i> whereas TestNG\'s assertEquals is <i>assertEquals(Object expected, Object actual, String message). </i>WTF! Given that TestNG came later - which reason did they have to swap the arguments? Just to make it harder to migrate from one to the other? This applies of course for all assert statements. I am just using assertEquals as an exmaple.<br /><br />Anyways, I started manually changing the calls, but that was just too tedious. It was time to get <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.htm\" id=\"bf60\" title=\"sed\">sed</a>  out again, but soon I realized that sed was not going to cut it this time, because there is no way do non <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression\" id=\"us_t\" title=\"greedy regular expressions\">greedy regular expressions</a> . The expression also had to take care of single and multi line statements. An example for a multi line statement would be:<br /><blockquote><br />assertEquals(                              <br />       \"Wrong propertyPath\",  <br />       propertyPath,   <br />       violation.getPropertyPath()<br />   );<br /></blockquote><br />Time to get good old perl out again. Here is what I came up with (the whole expression is one line!):<br /><blockquote> <br />perl -pi -0777 -e \'s/(assertEquals.|\\n*?)(\".*?\"),[ ,\\n,\\t]*(\\w*?,)([ ,\\n,\\t]*.*?)([ ,\\n,\\t]*)\\);/$1$3$4,$5$2\\ );/g\' MyClass.java<br /></blockquote><br />Well, it did not solve all my problems. In some cases the formatting was a little off, but that could be easily fixed with my IDE. Some comments about the expression:<br /><ul><li>the -i option allows editing of the file in-line.

The conference was similar to jfokus (<a href=\"http://www.highlevelbits.com/2009/01/jfokus-summary.html\" id=\"l1rf\" title=\"my summary here\">my summary here</a>). I hanged out with fellow architect Rikard Strand all day. Always great to have someone likeminded to discuss the talks with.<br /><br />The keynote was way better (compared to the strange JavaFX keynote at jfokus) with Kent Beck talking about the vital role of habits in shaping a good developer and a great team. I heard him talk 10 years ago at a conference in England (<a href=\"http://www.spaconference.org/ot99/\" id=\"yn:_\" title=\"OT99\">OT99</a>). Compared to that talk this was rather tranquil but nevertheless insightful. A great developer is not productive without great habits. And rather get a good developer with great habits than a great developer with lousy habits.<br /><br />We went on to the emerging technologies track. The first talk was about <a href=\"http://www.erlang.se/\" id=\"yzn7\" title=\"erlang\">erlang</a> - a language that was designed for concurrency for the telecom industry by Ericsson and that started to attract <a href=\"http://www.highlevelbits.com/2007/02/parallel-is-hard-word-to-spell-for.html\" id=\"ri_t\" title=\"some interest\">some interest</a> a couple of years ago. I was eager to see some code because I already heard enough about the language to get interested but unfortunately the speech was only bullet list and the like. More like a sales pitch. Erik Stenman that held the talk really seemed to know the subject so it certainly could have been a little bit more technical. But maybe he aimed for the suits and not for the geeks. Erlang is definitley on the to-learn list. A point made in this presentation was that it is easier to find good developers when writing in a less main stream language then say Java or C#. There aren&#39;t as many applicants as for a Java position but all that apply are good compared with Java where you can get applicants that can&#39;t code at all and many that are merely average.<br /><br />The next talk was about the cloud by John Davies. It was a very good talk where he showed how to set up a machine in the cloud using <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/\" id=\"lbw_\" title=\"amazons EC2 services\">amazons EC2 services</a>. Apparently it is easy enough. It is possible to be up and running a new Linux server in a couple of minutes. And the pricing of these services is more than reasonable.<br /><br />After lunch - which was very good by the way - I breaked out and enjoyed the sun and some geocaching instead of the talks. None of the 6 to choose from was tempting at all.<br /><br />Then came the lowmarks of the day. I want get into any details but we tried out both talks held in the methodology track and none of them were of much interest.<br /><br />Clean Code by <a href=\"http://emilybache.blogspot.com/\" id=\"vm16\" title=\"Emily Bache\">Emily Bache</a> was really good. She said all the things I wanted to hear about the subject and pointed out some reasons why it is so hard to get clean code. An interesting angle it that our reaction to a system that has unclean code is to rewrite it. This is often bad for several reasons. A system that works as intended should be possible to refactor but it is hard to refactor with unit testing when there are no units to test. A new approach to this problem is to use <a href=\"http://texttest.carmen.se/\" id=\"bit4\" title=\"TextTest\">TextTest</a> that approaches testing in another way. Log statements are inserted into the code before the refactoring and a test case is run. This creates a fixture that we can test against at a later stage. We do our refactoring and the tools makes sure that log statements comes out in the same order as before. A truly brilliant and simple solution to a rather complex problem. I haven&#39;t read the book by Uncle Bob with the same title as this talk. Maybe it is time to check it out.<br /><br />Then smalltalk! The language from where everything comes. It was a bit hilarious to find this talk about a 37 years ol language in the emerging technologies track. I have only used the language in school but have always wanted to work with languages like it. The syntax is so slick. Anders Janmyr held a very inspiring talk intertwined with code examples.<br /><br />The last talk by Andreas Steen from IBM about test automation said all the things right but failed to enthusiasm (which may have been due to being the last one.... tired me).<br /><br />All in all - a good day amongst fellow geeks! I might come back next year - too bad the conference is located in the small town of Gothenburg....</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 292,"revision_id": 292,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "<p>While I am on the &#39;discovering trip&#39;. Here is another thing I found out this week. This time I actually knew that this particular feature existed, but I never really knew how to use it and how it actually works. I am talking about <a href=\"http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn-book.html#svn.advanced.changelists\">svn changelists</a>. They are part of subversion since version 1.5 and so far were only something I read about. However, this week I discovered by accident the &#39;move to changelist&#39; button in the Intellij Idea svn plugin. I just tried it and immediately it dawned on my how useful this feature is. It allows me for example to move some files, which I always change, but never commit into a seperate changeset. This way I don&#39;t have to remember to either revert or not commit these files. You probably think that such files should not exists in a properly setup project, but what about for example log4j.properties. I personally like to collect log4j output in <a href=\"http://logging.apache.org/chainsaw/index.html\">Chainsaw</a> , but on the other hand I don&#39;t want to commit the log4j configuration file with the required socket appender enabled. Well, now I just moved log4j.properties into its own changelist and I don&#39;t have to think about it anymore.<br />From the command line you are using the changelist feature via the &#39;--changelist&#39; options which can be passed to most of the svn sub-commands. For example a checkin would look like this:</p><blockquote>svn commit -m &quot;my log message&quot; --changelist myChangeList</blockquote><p>One caveat though. I was assuming that committing without specifying a changelist would only commit the files which are not specifically in a changelist. Unfortunately, that&#39;s not the case. Instead all changes are committed. That&#39;s a clear drawback for me, but at least it is hidden from me when using the Idea plugin.<br /><br />Time to hand-over to Fredrik again for a less technical blog entry :)<br /><br />--Hardy</p>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 293,"revision_id": 293,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "My second Mac revelation of the week: <blockquote>cmd-~</blockquote>I was trying now for a while to figure out how to cycle the open windows of a single application.

Some of it conincides with my own ideas about the future. Consider this:</p><blockquote>As ever more people get connected, we see an acceleration in the way<br />the Internet is used to coordinate action and render services from<br />human input. We are witnessing the rise of a social nervous system.</blockquote><p>Makes sort of sense. People are increasingly interacting with (micro)blogs, social networking site status messages and instant messaging as it is the normal mode of being. This is all happening very fast. The internet isn&#39;t old at all yet it affects most peoples life in a very direct way. There will be new modes of interaction with each other over the web. It is likely that the modes of communication used today are just a beginning of a development that no one can forecast. At the end of this process - Internet will be an extension of the human being and a mode of communication that will be as natural as interacting with the &quot;physical&quot; world. If this turns out right this new nervous system will empower people and bring a new level of transparency to human society. Ross ends with:<br />&nbsp;</p><blockquote>Our lives are increasingly being logged on the Internet. It is part of<br />the trade. Given the complexity and precarious position of the modern<br />world, getting people to genuinely reach out and touch their neighbors<br />is a good thing but it will come at the price of reshaping our<br />identities as part of a larger, interconnected whole.</blockquote><p>An almost religious notion.</p><div><div>&nbsp;</div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 296,"revision_id": 296,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "<p>I have suspected for quite some time now that the web is outdated. Now and then Google turns up relevant articles that seem to be just right but after some reading it turns out that they are dated and not relevant anymore. I guess this is fine as long as there is some kind of time stamp on the page. I just searched for music festivals in Europe the summer to come and found <a href=\"http://studenttravel.about.com/od/coolevents/tp/music_fest_eurs.htm\" id=\"btef\" title=\"this nice list of festivals\">this nice list of festivals</a> at about.com. I started reading and got some nice tips for where to go. Then I read that Hultsfred &quot;is one of Europe&#39;s summer music festivals that does sell out&quot;. Wait a second - they did not sell out last summer - indeed they made a hefty deficit. And Radiohead will not play at Roskilde this summer.... So I scanned the page for any information about when it was written. The only thing I found was a &copy;2009 at the end together with an alternative headline with a very small font that said &quot;Top 10 Summer Concerts in Europe - Summer Concerts in Europe and Summer Music Festivals in Europe 2008&quot; instead of the title &quot;Hot Summer Concerts and Music Festivals in Europe&quot; that appeared on the top of the page. If I hadn&#39;t had some knowledge about last summers festivals I would have had no idea until I started browsing the actual festival sites. Now this case was manageable but imagine 50 years from now with 65 years of searchable and possibly outdated web pages.... and the pain to sort out what is relevant and what is not. Is this the use case where we need the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/\" id=\"iw3x\" title=\"semantic web\">semantic web</a> to save us? Or better search engines? Sometimes I want to get fresh information - sometimes it is fine with whatever. It depends on what I am searching for. Information about tourist sites in Paris won&#39;t change much over time whereas information about good restaurants in the same city is a completely different story.

I promised to approximate the talk as a blog post so here it is. (This was due to me mostly using pictures and code in the slides and had not that much text in them. So just passing on the slides wouldn&#39;t have helped much. Trying to apply <a href=\"http://www.presentationzen.com/\">presentation zen</a> whenever possible...) I have only used Rails for a couple of spare time projects so I don&#39;t really know all the details. I know enough though to contrast it against enterprise Java. I have worked with Java and J2EE for about 10 years. For many of those years I have had a distinct feeling that we are complicating things all the time. We have the <a href=\"http://www-01.ibm.com/software/awdtools/rup/\">unified process</a> that is supposed to solve all our cases but most of the time obfuscates the real purpose of projects. Documents and methodology become more important than the code that <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">is</span> the system. The technology we pick for our projects - most often J2EE or .net - is most of the time too much for the task at hand. I want you to start questioning these absolutes and start striving for alternative solutions.<br />&nbsp;</p><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dullhunk/202872717/\" title=\"Question Everything by dullhunk, on Flickr\"><img alt=\"Question Everything\" src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/62/202872717_a8a4799419.jpg\" style=\"width: 439px; height: 330px;\" /></a><br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: left;\">I will narrow my whining to Java and J2EE this time. How many <code>public String</code> did you write the last year? Or <code>public static final int</code>? And how many of those were really necessary. Java is fine as a programming language <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">but</span> do we really need a strongly typed language all the time? I think not. What is strongly typing really? It is just a way of testing the code to make sure that the developer has made the correct decisions. And the fine thing is that we have to do these tests to even compile the program. Using a strongly typed and compiled language is a kind of test driven development in the small. Now think about a developer that always write nice tests for all his code. Wouldn&#39;t those tests cover typing errors regardless of whether the language is typed or not? So if we can guarantee that we always have developers that test an untyped language like <a href=\"http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/\">Ruby</a> or Smalltalk might be used. Unfortunatley most developers are either lazy, careless or ignorant when it comes to test. More about this later.<br /><br />Another thing I just have to whine about is J2EE. We all know that J2EE solves all problems in the entire universe. Is this a good or a bad thing? It might be a good thing for big systems with many disparate needs. But do we really need all this complexity for the common semi-large system? Probably not. It seems to me that J2EE was manufactured by architects that have a need to point out how extremely complex their work is. And maybe sometimes it is but hardly all the time. Most systems I have worked with have been forced to use a complex solution - &quot;because that&#39;s the way we do it in this organization&quot; - where a much simpler solution would have worked just as well and might have resulted in less lines of code and hence less maintenance cost. But instead of whining I will suggest an alternative that makes it more fun to develop. Ruby on Rails. Keep in mind that this is just one of several light weight frameworks that increases productivity and makes it fun to be a developer again. I will comment on several other frameworks towards the end of this post.<br /><br />I will start with a brief discussion about the language (1) itself and then turn to the framework (2). Code will be used to show the simplicity compared to Java. Then I will tell you how to generate a sample application in just a few minutes (3) and lastly we will look at some tools (4) and take a look at the broader picture (5).<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;font-size:130%;\">The language</span><br /><br />It is important to look into the language when choosing a framework. A less mature language might give you unanticipated problems down the road. Questions to ask regarding this is:<br /><ul><li>does the target organization know the language or will it be able to learn?</li><li>is the resulting code easy to maintain?</li><li>is the standard library good enough?</li></ul><br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/kafeole/451053562/\" title=\"I swear I saw OO !! by kafeole, on Flickr\"><img alt=\"I swear I saw OO !!\" src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/205/451053562_d0f31b5694.jpg\" style=\"width: 397px; height: 276px;\" /></a></div><br />Ruby is a dynamically typed and object oriented language. Everything is an object and the standard library features instance methods all the time instead of the numerous class methods seen in Java. For example - in Java you would get the absolute value of a number by doing:<br /><blockquote><code>Math.abs(42);</code></blockquote>while in Ruby you go:<br /><blockquote><code>42.abs</code></blockquote>Which one is nicer? I know what I think! In Ruby you could even add your own method to a class in the standard library if you think there is a need for it. So it is a highly dynamic language. This could pose a problem if your developers are the lazy kind that doesn&#39;t do testing and doesn&#39;t adhere to coding guidelines agreed upon. Since the language is interpreted there is no compiler to catch small errors. With a strongly typed and compiled language there is always a first guard that catches typing errors. If you do test driven though - it shouldn&#39;t really make a difference at all. Another example that also illustrates is the following method that adds the items in an array and returns the results. In Java I would do something like:<br /><blockquote>
<pre>
public int sum( int[] a )
{
int y = 0;
for( i = 0; i &lt; a.length; i++ )
{
   y = y + a[i];
}
return y;
}</pre>
</blockquote>Note that we typically type the content of an array or a list in Java. Now look at the same method written in Ruby:<br /><blockquote>
<pre>
def sum a
y = 0
a.each do |x|
   y = y + x
end
y
end</pre>
</blockquote>This method accept any argument that has a method called &quot;each&quot; that can apply a code block to each item. The amount of code that is needed to solve a problem is less than in Java and in my opinion easier to read. It is also more flexible. You only need one method for parameters that has the method &quot;each&quot;. In Java you would need an interface. This should mean something for the maintainability of a system.<br /><br />Downsides of Ruby then? It might look like Perl due to a number of shortcuts that probably should be used sparsely and wisely if at all. It is a rather different looking language compared to C-ish languages. It might be hard to learn for unmotivated programmers. The standard library is not as fully featured as that of Java. If that is a problem - take a look a <a href=\"http://jruby.codehaus.org/\">jruby</a> - ruby that runs on the Java VM.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;font-size:130%;\">The framework</span><br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/13533187@N00/2377250982/\" title=\"Untitled by *Katch*, on Flickr\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2401/2377250982_85c1ede753.jpg\" style=\"width: 394px; height: 264px;\" /></a><br /><div style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</div></div>There are many kind of frameworks. In Java we often deploy several to solve different problems. We might use a web framework like Struts or JSF for the front end and Hibernate for database connectivity. Spring is a bit unique - it helps us all the way. Ruby on Rails is an MVC web and database framework. In some ways it resembles Struts. Model, controller and view have basically the same responsibilities. It would be possible to bind a Struts model directly to the database in the same way as Rails does. We seldom do it that way and if we did it would surely result in much more code than the equivalent code in Rails. The model in Rails is not defined in terms of classes - instead, database tables defines the model. And Ruby classes without much content are used to bind the database to the code.<br /><br />In our example we will build a site for web bookmarks. In this section I will walk you through the classes that are involved and in a later section I will show you how to generate these classes on the command line. In this extremely simple example there are 2 fields on a bookmark; a url and a description. The SQL to create a bookmarks table might look something like this:<br /><blockquote>
<pre>
CREATE TABLE &quot;bookmarks&quot;
(&quot;id&quot; INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL,
&quot;url&quot; varchar(255),
&quot;description&quot; text,
&quot;created_at&quot; datetime,
&quot;updated_at&quot; datetime);
</pre>
</blockquote>Nothing fancy there. To access this table from Rails we create a model class called Bookmark that extends ActiveRecord - one of the corner stones of Rails. The code looks like this:<br /><blockquote>
<pre>
class Bookmark &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
end
</pre>
</blockquote>Yepp - that&#39;s right. No code at all. All the magic is dynamically created by the base class ActiveRecord. It makes sure that there are accessors and mutators for the fields and has several nice methods to create, update, find and destroy a database entry. Some examples on how to use this class from a controller:<br /><br />To create and save a new bookmark:<br /><blockquote>
<pre>
b = Bookmark.new(
:url =&gt; &ldquo;http://www.dn.se&rdquo;,
:description =&gt; &ldquo;en tidning&rdquo; )
b.save</pre>
</blockquote>To create and save a new bookmark getting the data from an HTML form:<br /><blockquote>
<pre>
b = Bookmark.new( params[:bookmark] )
b.save</pre>
</blockquote>To find a bookmark with an id:<br /><blockquote>
<pre>
id = 42
Bookmark.find 42</pre>
</blockquote>To find all bookmarks:<br /><blockquote>
<pre>
Bookmark.find :all</pre>
</blockquote>If SQL is needed anyway:<br /><blockquote>
<pre>
Bookmark.find_by_sql &ldquo;select * from bookmarks&rdquo;</pre>
</blockquote>On to controller code. All code needed for a web request is put in the controller class. It is similar to action classes in Struts. An index action that gets all the bookmarks could look like this:<br /><blockquote>
<pre>
class BookmarksController &lt; ApplicationController

def index
@bookmarks = Bookmark.find(:all)
end

end
</pre>
</blockquote>The code just glues together the model and the view which in this case would look something like this:<br /><blockquote>
<pre>
&lt;h1&gt;Listing bookmarks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;% for bookmark in @bookmarks %&gt; 
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;th&gt;Url&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;%=h bookmark.url %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;%=h bookmark.description %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;</pre>
</blockquote><p>This is very similar to JSP. If you really don&#39;t like embedded code like this in your web page (you use tag libraries all the time) you should probably look elsewhere. Personally I think Ruby is much better embedded than Java.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;font-size:130%;\">Scaffolding </span></p><p>To generate this code (and some more...) you first need to install Rails. (There are one click installers for both Windows and Mac or you can use the nice built-in installer in Ruby called gem. For a working Ruby environment just go <code>gem install rails</code>.) Then generate a Rails project:</p><blockquote>
<pre>
rails demo
</pre>
</blockquote>This generates a directory structure with all the defaults of Rails. Go into the generated root directory and then generate code for a bookmark with an url and a description:<br /><blockquote>
<pre>
cd demo
script/generate scaffold bookmark url:string description:text
</pre>
</blockquote>This will generate the code displayed earlier in this post together with some tests. In the directory db/migrate there will be a Ruby script that defines the database. To install the database - run:<br /><blockquote>
<pre>
rake db:migrate
</pre>
</blockquote>Then start the server with <code>script/server</code> and direct your browser to http://localhost:3000/bookmarks where you will have a complete admin application for the bookmarks table. Empty tests are generated in test/integration and test/unit ready to be run with <code>rake test</code>.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;font-size:130%;\">Toolbox</span><br /><br />So - are there any tools for this nice framework? I have been using <a href=\"http://macromates.com/\">TextMate</a> for editing. It is a multi purpose text editor and works fine most of the time. It lacks code completion and refactoring support. The only IDE that I tried and that seems to work as good as Eclipse or NetBeans for Java is <a href=\"http://www.aptana.com/rails/\">RadRails</a>. NetBeans has support for Rails in its latest version but most of the stuff doesn&#39;t work (at least not on MacOS....). It probably will in the future.<br /><br />The classic way of deploying Rails applications is in Apache with either <a href=\"http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/\">Mongrel</a> or <a href=\"http://www.lighttpd.net/\">Lighttpd</a>. Now with jruby it is possible to deploy Rails applications in J2EE app servers like JBoss, WebLogic and WebSphere. This might be a nice alternative when trying to introduce Rails in a J2EE organization. It is just another kind of code running on the same infrastructure.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;font-size:130%;\">What about the others?</span><br /><br />There are several other ways of building web applications fast. While Rails might be a really good choice for most web applications there might be cases when the J2EE stack adds value somehow. And at the other end there might be even simpler application that is easily built with PHP. Easy and cheap as it is with many ISPs providing PHP support out of the box. PHP has several well supported CMS solutions that are morphing into web framworks. Take a look at <a href=\"http://drupal.org/\">Drupal</a> and <a href=\"http://www.joomla.org/\">Joomla</a>. For Python there is <a href=\"http://www.djangoproject.com/\">Django</a> - similar to Rails but without the database driven model of Rails. For Smalltalk (the coolest language?) users there is <a href=\"http://seaside.st/\">Seaside</a> - a very interesting option that takes the concept of Rails one notch further. Read more about the differences <a href=\"http://onsmalltalk.com/rails-vs-seaside\">here</a>. In the Java world there is <a href=\"http://www.grails.org/\">Grails</a> - a Rails copy built on <a href=\"http://groovy.codehaus.org/\">Groovy</a>. Other options with different strengths and weaknesses are <a href=\"http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/\">GWT</a>, <a href=\"http://wicket.apache.org/\">Wicket</a> and <a href=\"http://struts.apache.org/2.x/\">Struts 2</a>. Even <a href=\"http://java.sun.com/javaee/javaserverfaces/\">JSF</a> may be an option if you are tying different components together. When choosing a framework - it is important to look at several factors:<br /><ul><li>the current knowledge of the organization</li><li>the possibillity of learning in the organization</li><li>maintainability</li><li>productivity</li></ul>If you can hire one developer instead of 20 to do the same job - wouldn&#39;t that be nice?<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/exlibris/2441406789/\" title=\"Looking Up by ex.libris, on Flickr\"><img alt=\"Looking Up\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2124/2441406789_fcaaf7a9d4.jpg\" style=\"width: 373px; height: 249px;\" /></a></div></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 299,"revision_id": 299,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "<p>At <a href=\"http://www.highlevelbits.com/2009/01/jfokus-summary.html\" id=\"f.2y\" title=\"jfokus\">jfokus</a> I listened to a guy from Oracle talking about JPA 2.0.

This means that more people can attend and that the choice of great pubs after sessions is much, much better.<br /><br />First day is tutorial day. I aimed for maximum fluff so I turned down interesting offers about HTML 5, JavaFX and JPA/JAXB integration in favour of sessions about hyperactive teams running on scrum and the pomodoro technique, a personal micro time management method. Both sessions were definitely interesting.<br /><br />From the first session - by Adam Skogman of Skåne based consultants Jayway - I expected more about increasing productivity in an already up and running Scrum team. Instead the session was kind of a recap of Scrum basics with some pragmatism added. So lots of the stuff was already known to me. Nevertheless useful since I work in a scrum team now and it is good to be reminded of some of the practices. One thing I have been thinking about a lot lately is how to integrate test people with a scrum team. Adam suggested that test persons write test cases (as they always do) but they are then not tested manually but handed over to developers that implement the test cases as automated tests using Selenium (or WebTest). Will try to persuade our test leader about this approach. Manual test will still be needed but more for usability reasons. Functionality should be possible to test automatically all the way. Another good thing with this session was that I finally understood the idea of estimating with points rather than hours. Might blog more about that later.<br />&nbsp;</p><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/marco66/1017592641/\" title=\"DSC_06102007-08-05_15-42-47_c by Marco a.k.a.

The point is to chunk up ones time in 25 minute blocks and within each block focus on exactly one task. Pick a task, work on it for 25 minutes, rest 5 minutes, pick a new task or stick with the last one, work for 25 minutes, rest for 5 minutes. A 25 minute period is called a pomodoro. If you are disturbed during a pomodoro the pomodoro is lost and you will have to restart. If you are disturbed but manages to reschedule the distorsion you are fine. The progress is recorded: how many pomodoros you managed during a day, if you get distrubed and if it was internal (self inflicted) or external (phone, mail, questions). At the end of the day there should be time for some reflection on the day that passed so that improvements to the process can be made. <a href=\"http://blog.staffannoteberg.com/2008/02/22/pomodoro-technique-in-5-minutes/\" id=\"en:9\" title=\"Read more\">Read more</a> about it at Staffan Nötebergs blog.<br /><br />Second day is conference day. It started with a keynote about JavaFX of all things. Interesting concept but maybe not <b>that</b> interesting. A rather boring and fluffy presentation. But to be fair I wrote the first part of this blog post during the session so I never really gave Mr Ritter from Sun a chance to get my full attention.<br /><br />Then I went on to HTML 5 and its web sockets thing that brings full duplex communication to the browser world. Interesting stuff. The presentation was a bit technical but the implications of this new possibility worth pondering about for a while.<br /><br />After that I listened to a low detail take on performance and tuning that ended with a long description about how to make a hash thread safe and fast. I never really got it. Might have been a problem on my end - not sure. What I really missed though was a stern warning about doing premature optimizations. Talks like this might cause developers to go back to work with performance as one of their highest priorities which might <b>not be good at all</b> for the system at hand. Only tweak stuff like this after metrics show you that it is necessary. Lunch after this was refreshing.<br /><br />I had a hard time deciding what to do after lunch. Would I listen to DSL with Groovy or Domain Driven Design (yet another silver bullet?). Or maybe join the suits about agile organisations. Hanna convinced me that &quot;Controlling your architecture&quot; was the right thing to do. Turned out that this talk was interesting although it was much more about code and design than about architecture. Might be that the speaker only had experience from smaller systems. Anyway - I got with me hints to several tools that I would like to try out. <a href=\"http://www.headwaysoftware.com/products/structure101/index.php\" id=\"adai\" title=\"Structure 101\">Structure 101</a> seems to be a really nice code analyzer that generates graphs of package and class dependencies resulting in a very god overview of the system. I hope it works with Hudson.<br /><br />Finally time for my co blogger Hardy to enter the scene with a 15 minute lightning talk on Hibernate Search. With new really nice slides he managed to get a lot of information out in a very short time. Well done! He makes a strong case for using Hibernate Search when full text search needs to be combined with the real objects that hibernate provides. Hibernate Search removes the need to code this infrastructure by oneself.<br /><br />Then a semi weird talk about dependency injection which gave me some nice insights into <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/\" id=\"j2q1\" title=\"Google Guice\">Google Guice</a>. The talk ended with paraphrasing the pragmatic programmers suggestion to learn one new language every year with learn one new dependency injection framework every year. Hmmm - I certainly don&#39;t wanna do that.... Dependency injection is a nice thing but what we often forget is that we are adding complexity when we introduce it. It makes code harder to follow and read in exchange for increased testability and loose coupling. I dare say that dependency injection is not always the solution. As always - it depends.<br /><br />The conference day ended with a great talk about how to turn good developers into great developers by Chris Hedgate. Lots of common sense: don&#39;t be a star - be a guide and lead by example. Take the time to work with good developers so that they also one day might become great. Chris also made a great refactoring demo to illustrate how a great developer thinks. Simplify always. This was a great end to 2 nice days with some highs and some lows. For me - the best part is to meet and talk to many friends from previous projects. Some of us continued talking at the conference pub at Grodan and then later at Monks Bar.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 302,"revision_id": 302,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "<p>Here comes another edition out of the useful tools series. This time I want to recommend two online services which really work for me. With that I mean, I actually try them and stick to them without thinking after a short while:&quot; Yes, but ...&quot;. Of course these tools are more productivty tools. As you might have noticed, Fredrik is cleary responsible for the social network applications on this blog ;-)<br />The first application I want to recommend is <a href=\"https://www.rememberthemilk.com/\">Remember The Milk</a> or just RTM (maybe I have done this before?). It is a task list organizer which is just great. I had some initial problem understanding the way the UI works, since it does some strange DHTML stuff when you are hovering over a task list. That is when you use the mouse. When you take the time to learn some of the keyboard shortcuts you will love this tool even more. The beauty of RTM is that I don&#39;t have to be online all the time. I can access a mobile version from my phone or even better send a new task to RTM by sending a text message to Twitter (and yes, I created a Twitter account just for that!) There is also a plugin which allows you to integrate you tasks into <a href=\"http://www.google.com/calendar\">Google Calendar</a>. Over time I tried so many different task organizers, but this one really works for me.<br />The second application I want to recommend is <a href=\"http://www.getdropbox.com/\">Dropbox</a>. It is basically another online data store. Nothing special really. The reason this tool convinced me is the integration with my Mac. It is just awesome. After installing the Dropbox application on my computer I can see an addtional folder in my finder and I can just drag&amp;drop files into it and they get immediately synchronized to my web storage. I even get feedback whether the synchronization is complete via some nice icons. Of course there is also a web interface to dropbox where you can also the history of each file. This means usng dropbox gives you also some sort of version control for files placed into it. It is also great for any files you want to either just access from the internet or maybe edit from multiple different computers. Dropbox also has the concept of public folders into which you can drop files. This files are then accesible via URLs dropbox creates for you. You can even create online picture albums on Dropbox. The only downer is that the free account only offers you 2 GB. If you want to use more you have to upgrade and pay for more space. There is also no option to just pay what you use for. Instead you have to go to a 5 GB plan right away (I think). Currently I just stick to the free 2 GB and use Dropbox for simple documents.<br />Anyways, have to run ...<br />--Hardy</p>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 303,"revision_id": 303,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "<p>To step ahead of myself here - everything!<br />I am now living for several years in Sweden, but one of things I remember well are my first experiences shopping for bread.

Well, there are a few, but they don&#39;t<br />sell what I would call bread. So where do Swedes get there bread from ? From the supermarket would be the general answer. In fact each average stocked Swedish supermarket has at least two shelves of different bread types. Probably over 100 types of so called &quot;fresh&quot; breads. That is of course if you consider factory made, pre-sliced and packaged breads as fresh.<br />I also quickly learned that out of this supposedly big assortment only a few breads were actually eatable. In fact one of the first Swedish words I&#39;ve learned was &quot;osötad&quot;, meaning &quot;unsweetened&quot;. This was the one single word i had to look out for when buying bread, since most breads in Sweden would have syrup added to them in order to sweeten them. And this is just wrong! Unfortunately, the sole fact that I prefer my bread to be unsweetened reduces my choice from over a hundred down to a handful. None of them particularly good and definitely without crust. Funny enough a good crust actually makes a bread &quot;sweet&quot; to a certain degree due to the caramelized starches in the crust, but believe me that cannot be faked by adding syrup.<br />Anyways, that were just a few of my own experience, but why do I think it is worth blogging about this? Haven&#39;t I got used to the Swedish way by now? To a certain degree yes, but I just realized that I am not alone. I owe this insight to &quot;<a href=\"http://www.hemligekocken.se/\">Den Hemlige Kocken</a>&quot; from Mats-Eric Nilsson. This book opened my eyes. Not only did I finally realize that the &quot;problem with bread&quot; was not the strange excrescence<br />of a German living in Sweden. No, there are other people out there who think likewise. And they are Swedish! &quot;Den Hemlige Kocken&quot; shows you what is wrong with food production and habits in sweden or most parts of the the westernized world as a matter of fact. For example, it shows what a fake the seemingly big bread assortment is. Effectively there is less than a handful of factories producing all the same low quality product. The trick is to package and brand it in many different ways in order to create the illusion of choice. It is almost magic, until you look behind the scenes.<br />Sadly bread is just the beginning. I urge everyone who is interested in food (and able to read Swedish) to get a copy of this book. In case you are too lazy to read just watch &quot;Unser täglich Brot&quot;. In the latter case you don&#39;t even need to understand German. The whole movie is without a single word, but it shows in a terrible way how soulless and inhuman food production has become.<br />However, more importantly than reading a book or watching a film is to actually do something about this tasteless and soulless food. Next time you go to the supermarket ask the store owner why there is such a limited choice of fresh and local produce in the shop. Ot try to find a real bakery or a small shops selling real fresh produce. Or you could join such great initiatives as <a href=\"http://www.slowfood.com/\">Slow Food</a>? Believe me, once you tasted the difference, there is no going back.<br />Wau, now I got this off my chest. It really troubled me :) I would like to finish this post with a link to a <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/\">TED</a> talk which I accidentally discovered the other day. Fittingly it is a<br />talk of Peter Reinhart about <a href=\"http://video.ted.com/talks/podcast/PeterReinhart_2008P_480.mp4\">bread</a>. It&#39;s great.

The difference - if I have grasped it correctly - is that Pandora actively attribute properties to all songs whence last.fm relies on simliarities between users and seems to do this on an artist level rather than on a song level. Another - maybe more important - difference is the user interface. Pandora is really nice and slick while last.fm looks more like a normal web site.

Shocked that stock indexes can loose up to <b>20%</b> of their value in <b>one</b> day!?<br /><br />Surprise, surprise - this is not a new problem. The unsustainable practices which brought on the current crisis are known for a long time, even books have been written about them, for example &quot;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Liars-Poker-Rising-Through-Wreckage/dp/0140143459\" id=\"khkz\" title=\"Liar\'s Poker\">Liar&#39;s Poker</a>&quot; by Michael Lewis - published <b>1989</b>. If you want to get a better knowledge about what&#39;s going on right now, read the book. You will be a lot wiser afterward, but don&#39;t expect to understand. Understanding seems just not possible right now.<br /><br />Personally, I think that the whole crisis was brought on by a very old myth. The abiltiy to make gold out of sand or money for nothing. If I would claim our days that I could transform sand to gold the absurdity of this claim would hopefully be for most people quite obvious. Unfortunately, the money for nothing schemes which let the world economy collapse at the moment are much more sophisticated and for a layperson almost impossible to see through. But that should not be an excuse for anyone. Everyone should have been suspicious by the <i>guaranteed </i>interest gains promised by many of these dodgy investments. One should always remember - <i>from nothing nothing comes</i>.<br /><br />And even in this crisis I can see parallels in the development world. Take for example the <a href=\"http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/NINA\" id=\"u6to\" title=\"NINA\">NINA</a> mortgages which to a great extend brought on the current disaster. There is a direct parallel in the development world. It&#39;s called <a href=\"http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/Crap+In+Crap+Out\" id=\"rsx6\" title=\"CICO\">CICO</a>. In my rather short career I already had the &quot;pleasure&quot; to work on several projects which got into difficulties due to CICO. The customer wanted to have this great new functionality, wanted to be part of Web 2.0, wanted it now. And all this of course without changing the underlying obsolete structures like the completely crusted, inconsistent and out of date database. Common sense suggests to at least address the issues and mitigate potential problems by for example adding an additional layer of indirection. But that&#39;s maybe just me, since many times I just fell on deaf ears.<br /><br />I think it is time to stop building sand castles and remember that every system needs a solid foundation. A free market does not mean money can be made from nothing. A sustainable market has to be based on sustainable values.<br /><br />Well, that were my 0.02$ to the topic.<br /><br />--Hardy</p>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 312,"revision_id": 312,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "<p><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/R0aStuOLSRoz0Mje2XMYag\"><img src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/hardy.ferentschik/SOSL44jx6lI/AAAAAAAAANM/MNA-GW1c0cU/s288/meme.jpg\" /></a></p><br /><p>From <a href=\"http://sacha.labourey.com/2008/10/01/mememe/\">Sacha</a>:</p><p>1.

Molly E. Holzschlag gives an interesting view into the web standards organizations and the mechanisms that&nbsp;drive web standards. This is not uplifting reading at all despite the optimistic note towards the end:</p><blockquote>Can we solve the problem? I&rsquo;ve never been a fortune teller, but I am an optimist. I believe we have amazing people in each of these circles who can come together and make things happen.</blockquote><p>I am more of a pessimist so I would place my money on a future with bad standards. Still - bad standards are better than no standards at all. After all - it is easier to be a web developer these days than it used to be. I like to think that this is because more and better standards. The tools are better and the number of things that don&#39;t work in Internet Explorer are not that numerous any more. Pragmatically speaking - there is progress. Could standards be better - definitely. I spent almost a day last week explaining the XML Schema standard (oops - it is not a standard - it is a <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema\" id=\"n9sf\" title=\"recommendation\">recommendation</a>....) to a group of people attending an XML course for beginners. They asked me: &quot;Why is it so complicated?&quot;. I had no answer to that. (For those lucky few of you that aren&#39;t XML-enabled it is easy to summarize the complexity. To define</p>

<p>With some imagination it is not hard to see where this is leading....)&nbsp;My teacher&nbsp;colleague Mathias Franzén&nbsp;pointed out that things may be unnecessarily complex but once embraced by the critical mass there is no turning back. XML Schema is like that. It has become the de facto standard for all large organizations. Sad - since there is this nice alternative called <a href=\"http://relaxng.org/\" id=\"ne:7\" title=\"RELAX NG\">RELAX NG</a> that has the same functionality without the unnecessary complexity.&nbsp;</p><div>Anyway - back to the article. The 3 circles of hell are (1) standards organizations with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/\" id=\"uuzb\" title=\"W3C\">W3C</a>&nbsp;playing the lead part, (2) independent organizations like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.whatwg.org/\" id=\"sbad\" title=\"WHATWG\">WHATWG</a> &nbsp;and finally (3) corporations. They all drive standards in their different ways and all have pros and cons that are nicely listed in the article. A glimmer of hope in the darkness is the newly initiated&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.webfoundation.org/\" id=\"mxf-\" title=\"World Wide Web Foundation\">World Wide Web Foundation</a>&nbsp;founded by Tim Berners-Lee (whom we all respect). This foundation will &quot;advance one web that is free and open&quot;, &quot;expand the web&#39;s capability and robustness&quot; and finally &quot;extend the web&#39;s benefit to all people on the planet&quot;. One first guess is that W3C might as well stand behind this kind of statements. What makes this different is the aim for an economic model where the standards&nbsp;organization&nbsp;is not economically dependent on the good will of big corporations - with their own evil agendas - but has independent funding.

I thought it is time to air some first impressions. This is of course not a thorough review, but rather some random observations. I would be intrigued if others share my experiences.<br /><br />Let&#39;s starts some cons. What is the deal with the lid lock? It feels really flimsy when closed and while I know that I have stubby fingers I am almost sure that other people must have problems as well pressing the button to open the lid. I know things have to look shiny, but surely that lock could be done better without compromising the unique Mac design. Once open and up and running there is not much to complain about. One thing I cannot figure out though. Maybe it is a relict from my not so distant PC times, but what is the deal with the <i>Command</i> key? Fair enough that in most Mac application the <i>Control</i> key is replaced by the <i>Command</i> key. I guess I could get used to it, but for heaven&#39;s sake be consistent. Once you are working with a bash it&#39;s suddenly the <i>Control </i>key again. My guess is Apple just did not dare to replace the <i>Control </i>key with the <i>Command </i>key in the bash. Just imagine the outcry from all the shell power users. For my part the <i>Control</i> key could just have been removed. Well, maybe I haven&#39;t thought this completely though yet, but so far I wish it would be true since it confuses still the heck out of me. Another con in my eyes is the locations of some configuration files and the departing of the classical directory layout in Mac OS X. Given its Unix root is just seems wrong to me. In some cases this might be understandable, but why is my home directory under <i>/Users/hardy</i> instead of <i>/home/hardy</i>, especially since <i>/home</i> seems still to exists?<br /><br />But enough cons. There are a lot of pros and overall I am more than happy with my new machine. Especially nice is that Mac OS X boots so fast and that the sleep mode actually works. It is the first time I own a computer where the sleep mode is working the way I expect it to work. Just have as many progams as you want running, enter sleep mode, reopen the computer and off you go again. Sweet. I am also impressed by the Look&amp;Feel of many of the build in Mac apps. It is just a pleasure to work with them. And yes, in many cases it is just gloss, but that&#39;s what you pay for, isn&#39;t&nbsp; it? The dock is also one of these things which are just great. I love it. Small little details, like the blue dot indicating that the program is actually running. And the way icons expands when you hover over them. Just sweet. Battery life so far is ok, even though I&#39;ve heard storries about rapidly degrading battery life. Fingers crossed that this is not happening to me any time soon. Overall performance is great and so far I had none of this annoying &quot;why is the system so slow now?&quot; moments.<br /><br />And last, but definitely not least - it&#39;s just soooo slick.<br /><br />Bottom line - I love it :)<br /><br />--Hardy</p>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 315,"revision_id": 315,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "The last few weeks I have been flying a fair bit and came multiple across the following machine (sorry not quite sharp):<br /><br /><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/hardy.ferentschik/Blog/photo#5235460923507533506\"><img src=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/hardy.ferentschik/SKgX-KUa5sI/AAAAAAAAAKw/rQKfOga6XjE/s400/DSC00010.JPG\" /></a><br /><br /><div id=\"jonu\" style=\"padding: 1em 0pt; text-align: left;\">I have seen this machine many times before and have also witnessed many people struggle with it.

We are going to <a href=\"http://www.storsjoyran.se/\">Storsjöyran</a> in Östersund end of next week. It is a music festival with some bands we know from before and lots of bands we have never heard of. So in order to get the most out of it I browsed the web for audio samples from all the bands. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/\">Youtube</a> is the best place to find stuff fast and it worked fine for most bands. Bands like Kuda, Kira Kira however was tricky to find. Up with <a href=\"http://last.fm/\">last.fm</a> where only musical artists are searched for and it was easy to find. (last.fm has remade their design - looks really nice.) This made me think of the importance of good names.<br /><br />Another factor to take in account is the named items popularity. Madonna might not have been that good of a name if it was new today. Now the word refers more to the artist and less to the holy virgin Mary then surely was the case when her career started. The artist has redefined the meaning of madonna with her popularity.<br /><br />This applies to all kind of names that is in need of searchability. Musical artists, companies, pieces of software, magazines etc. Brands really. Basically all named objects that have a long life and need to be easily found with the help of a search engine. I figure that a movie might not need a uniwue name although it wouldn&#39;t hurt.<br /><br />Generic search has made it more important that names are unique across all domains whereas before Internet it was sufficient with uniqueness within the domain at hand. (Thinking about Madonna again....) Global uniqueness has been important also but <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/07/hitting-40-languages.html\">recent developments</a> may change this. A bit at least - so that global uniqueness within a language will be sufficient.<br /><br />Anyway - I&#39;m gonna have a well deserved vacation with as little computer time as possible.

One code example got me started on one of my favorite subjects - the abundance of null checks in source code. This is the example code I saw inside a custom converter example class:<br /><br /><code>public String getAsString(FacesContext context,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;UIComponent component,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Object value)<br />{<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;if( context == null || component == null )<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;{<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;throw new NullPointerException();<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;}<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;// and obviously some more code here....<br />}</code><br /><br />This doesn&#39;t make sense at all since if the params are null there will eventuelly be a NullPointerException raised anyway. This method is supposed to be called by the JSF framework so it makes even less sense. Why would a framework call a custom converter class with null values? I saw similar code yesterday in the huge code pile I am working with now for a customer. The difference was that a checked exception was thrown instead of an unchecked. That is even worse since every caller of the method need to deal with that exception and - in this case - the source fault (null value of a param) was not mentioned at all. Just a generic &quot;this was not good&quot; message. I suggest that null values can take care of themselves. If someone passes in null for a param that never should be null a NullPointerException is a brilliant outcome with the stack trace showing us exactly where the null value was discovered.&nbsp;</p>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 320,"revision_id": 320,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "<p>When I was a student at the <a href=\"http://www.uni-karlsruhe.de/\" id=\"m4v1\" title=\"University of Karlsruhe\">University of Karlsruhe</a> I spend a lot of time maintaining and administrating a heterogeneous Linux/Solaris/Irix/Windows environment at the <a href=\"http://i31www.ira.uka.de/\" id=\"j0ug\" title=\"Institute of Human Computer Interaction\">Institute of Human Computer Interaction</a>. I remember the long hours trying to compile and install custom software. At the time there were just Makefiles one had to manually configure. If you were lucky you had some <i id=\"wm1e\">configure</i> scripts. Package management systems like <i id=\"ztra\">dpkg</i> and <i id=\"mp2g\">rpm</i> were just becoming popular. And just to defend myself from all the old time veterans - yes I did not have to work with punch cards, put at times it almost felt this way. Hours past trying to find out why something would not compile or why <i id=\"d8zo\">this</i> Makefile would not work on an Irix machine. On the other hand, I believe that to the day I benefit from all the hours spend on these tasks. Not that my software development skills improved that much, but one develops almost something like a sixth sense for determining what&#39;s wrong. It&#39;s not knowing what&#39;s wrong, but rather having a hunch. It&#39;s also about doing research to find a solution and then discarding all recommendations, because you really believe in your hunch :) Since I started to work as professional software developer though, I kind of forgot about these times. I guess it is only fair enough to expect that infrastructural things just work. You spend enough time troubleshooting your own code. Once you spend 8 hours a day, 5 days a week in front of a computer it is not really fun anymore to find out why some software does not install or work. You give it a one time shot and if it does not work it goes! Yesterday, however, I had a little trip down memory lane. I am a proud owner of a <a href=\"http://www.slimdevices.com/\" id=\"im1e\" title=\"Squeezebox\">Squeezebox</a> and I must say it is probably one of the best gadgets I bought for a long time. Unfortunately, my little mp3 server feeding my squeezebox with music failed me yesterday and all attempts to resurrect were in vain. The only way out was to find a new server. And was there not somewhere an old Dell Inspiron 5000 notebook in the cellar? That should work right? It does, but it took me 5 hours to get it working. Installing the latest <a href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download\" id=\"nkwn\" title=\"Ubuntu Server edition\">Ubuntu Server Edition</a> was still quite painless (even though I first tried with the desktop version and failed). Since the notebook only had a build in 56K modem, I had to plug in a old PCMCIA wireless network card - a <a href=\"http://support.dlink.com/products/view.asp?productid=DWL-650%2B\" id=\"mz8d\" title=\"DLINK DWL-650+\">DLINK DWL-650+</a> (by now a discontinued product). Here the trouble started. I could not get the card to work, even though some people claim that the Ubuntu installer recognized this card out of the box. No such luck for me. After some research I thought the solution was to compile and install the <a href=\"https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/acx100\" id=\"wvsr\" title=\"ACX100 driver\">ACX100 driver</a> source. So I did. An hour later the driver was compiled and installed and the card detected, but no luck with actually connecting to the network. Back to the drawing board. Apparently there is a project called <a href=\"http://hansengel.wordpress.com/2007/11/10/installing-a-wireless-driver-with-ndiswrapper/\" id=\"ezm4\" title=\"NDISWrapper\">NDISWrapper</a> which allows you to use windows drivers on Linux (wau - I did not know that this exists!). Interestingly enough several users where actually discouraging you from using this driver in case of a acx100 chip-set. The ACX stuff should really work. But I&#39;ve been there done that. I decided to give <a href=\"http://hansengel.wordpress.com/2007/11/10/installing-a-wireless-driver-with-ndiswrapper/\" id=\"boud\" title=\"NDISWrapper\">NDISWrapper</a> a go. Download and compilation went well, but after an <i id=\"nbo1\">make install</i> nothing happened. More troubleshooting lay ahead of me. Another hour later it was clear that somehow the Makefile did not work in my case. The kernel module was build, but not installed in the right location. Go figure!? After some manual copying the module was loaded and the network interface up. Now it was time to learn about <i id=\"o65o\">iwconfig</i> which I haven&#39;t used before. That was quite painless and 15 minutes later I was connected to my wireless network. Things became much easier from there. Not much one can do our-days on a computer which is not connected to the net. Installing <a href=\"http://wiki.slimdevices.com/index.cgi?SqueezeCenter\" id=\"tn4c\" title=\"squeezecenter\">squeezecenter</a> was a breeze - just a question of adding the right source repository to <i id=\"uf5e\">sources.list</i> and a simple <i id=\"j4or\">apt-get install</i>. At the time I was quite frustrated about the time it took me to get things going, but in hindsight I am quite proud. Not only reminds me the experience now of my old study times, I also refreshed my memory regarding Linux, network configuration, module compilation, apt. Overall a good experience, but it will have to last for a while now again :)</p>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 321,"revision_id": 321,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "<p>Once in a while you come across blogs which summarize in such brilliant ways the current state and problems in the IT industry that all you can do is create some links and hope that more people read these excellent blog entries:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://brucefwebster.com/2008/04/11/the-wetware-crisis-the-dead-sea-effect/\">The Wetware Crisis: the Dead Sea effect</a></li><li><a href=\"http://brucefwebster.com/2008/04/14/the-longest-yard-reorganizing-it-for-success/\">The Longest Yard: Reorganizing IT for Success</a></li><li><a href=\"http://brucefwebster.com/2008/04/15/the-wetware-crisis-the-themocline-of-truth/\">The Wetware Crisis: the Thermocline of Truth</a></li></ul><p>Funny enough - it is nothing new Bruce describes here.

A developer is supposed to annotate his bean with validation rules rather than code it in controller classes all over the system. This is probably a very nice effort to sort out one of the problems with the whole J2EE thing. It starts me wondering though. It seems like Java is moving from actual code towards more and more of the annotation stuff. (Which I don&#39;t like at all from the artistic perspective....) Annotations make sense for many things - mostly for matters concerning infrastructural issues. It also makes sense to annotate in order to validate proper values in a Java bean. And it highlights a problem that has been there all the time since Java beans appeared. The Java beans standard isn&#39;t really object oriented. It kind of assumes that a get/set pair encapsulates one field. The requirement of having an empty constructor also emphasizes that you can never trust a Java bean instance. The values can be whatever. And that is the reason you need a validation annotation framework. I think it is sad that a nice object oriented language like Java is used mostly for functional programming. Also sad is the complexity that is added when making workarounds for solving these issues.</p>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 325,"revision_id": 325,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "Here comes another little curiosity.

In Heat Bill Buford embarks on a mission to learn the secrets of preparing food by joining a famous chef (<a href=\"http://www.mariobatali.com/\" id=\"d27:\" title=\"Mario Batali\">Mario Batali</a>) in his New York restaurant. He starts off as a kitchen slave and slowly works himself up to become a line cook. However, he also realizes that there is only so much to learn as a line cook. He produces great food, however always under the constraint that it has to be fast, re-producible and consistent. The love is missing. As he sees several of his working colleagues going to Italy to really learn the art of cooking (Mario&#39;s restaurant servers Italian-American food) he decides to join them and go back to the roots. He wants to learn how food is prepared with love, in small restaurants using recipes handed down by generations.<br /><br />I feel somehow in a similar way. I love working with computers. I choose my career, because I love doing what I am doing. However, working as a consultant I feel more and more as a software line cook. My task is to solve similar problem over and over again using proven recipes. Preferably arriving at the final product faster and faster, increasing productivity. As I do so I feel my passion for the craft more and more disappearing.

Kabutz\">Dr. Heinz M. Kabutz</a> on this blog before - when I realized how interesting and potentially far reaching implications the usage of Strings can have. I consider myself to be a competent Java developer and I know that if I want to concatenate Strings I should use a StringBuilder or StringBuffer. However, I did not know that I should not synchronize on a String. I probably would not have done it anyway, since some long time ago I&#39;ve learned to synchronize on an Object instance, but I did not know why I should do it this way. I also did not know what exactly String.intern()is good for. I have seen it many times browsing the Java Docs, but never really took the time to understand it.<br /><br />Anyways, reading the newsletter I got intrigued and started to surf the net for more information and soon realized how far reaching the simple usage of a String can become and that String manipulation could be the cause of performance problems. This blog entry I found especially interesting - <a href=\"http://thought-bytes.blogspot.com/2007/03/java-string-performance.html\" id=\"ckjq\" title=\"Java String performance\">Java String performance</a>. However, I don&#39;t think you should refactor all your String usage now. I am a firm believer in profiling before improving, but it is still interesting to keep certain facts about such a simple thing as String usage stored away in some dark corner of your brain.<br /><br />This little excursion into the world of Strings also reminded me of an article I read a while ago (unfortunately I just cannot dig it up again - maybe someone else can help?). In essence the article tried to answer the question whether all the layers of abstraction we have within the IT world really make it easier, quicker and safer to implement applications. Somehow it does, however each single abstraction is build by humans, meaning it is as prone to error and bugs than the very application you try to write using these abstractions. If you are sitting somewhere at the top of this pile of abstractions and a lower level abstraction fails how possible is it that you are able to understand and fix the problem? Will it not become harder and harder to control all these layers and abstractions. Taking the example of a String - who out there can still explain to me all the layers involved manipulating this string. Starting with the JVM, over to the OS and IO operations all the ways down to CPU registers.</p>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 331,"revision_id": 331,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "<p>Many but not all programmers believe they have a creative work.

Great stuff. Ever tried to trigger multiple profiles? Great in theory, but unfortunately in this case maven is not delivering what one would expect - especially when you have the the same properties in multiple profiles and you want the values of the &#39;last&#39; profile activated to be the effective ones. This is exactly how <i>settings.xml </i>works. If a profile in <i>settings.xml</i> is activated and it defines a property which was already set by another profile it overrides its value. Not so with multiple profiles defined in <i>pom.xml</i>. Say we have to two profiles default and override defined as follows in <i>pom.xml</i>:</p>
<pre>
&lt;profile&gt;
  &lt;id&gt;default&lt;/id&gt;
  &lt;properties&gt;
  &lt;test&gt;DEFAULT&lt;/test&gt;

Read more in the <a href=\"http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/Getting_started_guide\">developer wiki</a>. The business counterpart of facebook - LinkedIn - <a href=\"http://blog.linkedin.com/blog/2007/06/the-linkedin--1.html\">announced in June</a> that they will release an API as well.

We bought a Magellan GPS 2 weeks ago and have found 13 caches this far. Today we found a travel bug and a geocoin - these are trackable items that people send on journeys. The travel bug started its trip in Australia heading for England. We pick it up at one place and drop it off at some other place that is hopefully closer to its destination.

I started looking at the blogs I would like to catch up with today and it seems that there are people that actually work during summer.<br /><br />I started the vacation with a lengthy week of Denmark all on my own.

After that I turned to Jutland and a piece of Vesterhavet. It is really awesome to listen to the roaring of the mighty ocean.<br /><br />Three weeks at home was interrupted by a cruise to Riga with Käthe. Riga still has remains of the Soviet era - the old town is quite similar to Visby.<br /><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/froderik/1093511964/\" title=\"Photo Sharing\"><img alt=\"distant chania from beach\" height=\"180\" src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1069/1093511964_f4346b2bc9_m.jpg\" style=\"margin: 10px; float: left;\" width=\"240\" /></a><br />A week in Chania on Crete with almost all our kids became the high mark of the doing nothingness of this vacation.

I added a topic called &quot;Fredrik Rubensson&quot;. A topic is what OO people would call an instance. A topic can be of several types - my topic example is both a Person and a Software Developer. Every type come with a set of attributes that are smashed together on the topic page to create a united view. And - of course - every attribute can be related to a type and get its possible value from that. I tried to add Movie as a type - it worked just fine and I got a long list of attributes related to movies. The interface is intuitive and nice to work with. Text fields have auto completion that makes it easy to find types and topics.<br /><br />Drawbacks? As with wikipedia - my instinctive reaction is - will this really work? It is similar to wikipedia but requires an extra level of analysis from its editors that most people just don&#39;t have. The result may be a mess of types and topics.

This is not different from the early Internet. The anonymity makes it easier to engage in stuff that wouldn&#39;t normally be on the agenda. So this law means that companies should stay away from the dirt.

<pre>

<p>For some reason svn would then always prompt me for a password for</p>

<p>, where hardy is my user name on the local machine. I couldn&#39;t really figure out what was going on. It seemed that the user name specified via <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">--username</span> was not getting passed to the ssh client. I then tried:</p>
<pre>
svn checkout svn+ssh://hardy.ferentschik@servername/projectname/trunk</pre>
<p><span>which worked fine. I completely forgot about this problem for a while. Until yesterday that is. I wanted to configure a <a href=\"http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.0/ch07s03.html\">svn:external</a> link from one project to another in order to be able to check them out into the same directory. svn:external works similar to <a href=\"http://ximbiot.com/cvs/wiki/index.php?title=CVS--Concurrent_Versions_System_v1.12.12.1:_Reference_manual_for_Administrative_files#Ampersand_modules\">cvs ampersand modules</a> and can be a very useful feature.<br /><br />For the svn:external property I couldn&#39;t use the url with my username in it, </span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> </span><span>since then everyone checking out the project would have to authenticate with my credentials. Not really a solution. I had to use </span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">svn+ssh://servername/projectname/trunk</span><span>. But now of course my problem re-appeared.<br /><br />First I tried to find a solution in the svn documentation and on the svn forums, but there is really only the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">--username</span> option. I was already close to giving up when I thought that if I just could tell ssh which user to use. That was the right path and after a little more search I found out about the <a href=\"http://www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man5/ssh_config.5.html\">config</a> file in the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">.ssh </span>directory. I&#39;ve never used it before so I did not even know that it existed. Anyway, the simple solution to my problem was to create a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">config</span> file in my <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">.ssh</span> directory and putting the following in:
<pre>Host servername
User hardy.ferentschik
</pre>
<br />That fixed the problem :) I still would claim that there must be a bug in the svn client implementation when using <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">--username</span> together with <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">svn+ssh</span>.

Any imaginable phone may ring when that specific number is called. This is of course a huge step forward making it cheaper to be reachable at all times. I guess this is the reason people actually have satellite cell phones. For a more primitive being like myself the potential reachableness is already high enough. I am thinking more about turning the phone off and not bringing it along all the time. I don&#39;t need to be reachable when I am out playing basket with my kids. The kids is the only reason I have the phone on at most times. If they really need me I want to reachable. If my customer or my mother or my cousin or my friend needs me - they can wait until I am within reach again. Given all this it is amazing to think that we actually managed to live without cell phones 15 years ago.<br /><br />Enough about phones. This GrandCentral thing that <a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/03/the_web_20_addr_1.html\">O&#39;Reilly Radar was kind enough to inform me about</a> made me start thinking about what we really need in the web 2.0 era. Phone numbers are a primitive way to id things. It is a way we are used to - we feel the same way about bank account numbers and credit card numbers. But email and web addresses shouldn&#39;t be numbers. Strange. I mean - it is all numbers underneath in the IP protocol so we could just as well know google.com by <a href=\"http://64.233.187.99/\">64.233.187.99</a> as we know my cell phone number by +46708196692.<br /><br />So suppose we could get rid of phone numbers and replace it with something similar to email addresses and that we could have exactly one address that could be used for different kinds of text messaging and voice calls. We need a handle that uniquely represents a person and that is the only handle needed to communicate with a person. This <a href=\"http://openid.net/\">OpenID thing</a> may be a candidate to use. Many persons have a kind of OpenID approach anyway using the same id and password for any not-so-important site. Uniting it would be a huge step forward securitywise. A future step will be to have the open identity as address for all contacts with a person.<br /><br />Phones will join the Internet eventually. And Internet will mature and be more tool and less toy.</p>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 359,"revision_id": 359,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "<p>Kenneth Sutton - author of <a href=\"http://homefries.org/\">Homefries</a> - one of the blogs I&#39;ve been reading for a while - has written an interesting article about <a href=\"http://www.uuworld.org/life/articles/16206.shtml\">going to church in Second Life</a>.

A strength with this kind of presence is that if a church un Second Life is shared with all Universalists the world over there may always be someone that shares your interest and beliefs online in Second Life. Extend it to any subculture that is nongeographically oriented and that depends on people meeting to share an experience - the power of a place like Second Life maybe becomes more obvious. The emergence of the web made it possible to share text and graphics. The emergence of a three dimensional web will make it possible to share experiences.

In swedish it comes with 4 l as in parallell so when doing some searches I only got swedish hits.... I started thinking a bit about parallel computing after reading <a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/02/a_fast_waitfree_1.html\">these interesting fragments</a> of an internal O&#39;Reilly conversation on the matter. The point is that processors are not gonna get much faster in the future so our hope for faster computing lies in making them run in parallel. This is a prospect worth thinking about for a while. Will this new hardware architecture imply a change in how we construct software? Probably. Java, for example, doesn&#39;t have built-in support for massive parallelism. Java has threads but they have to be created by the programmer. EJB application servers might be able to use many processors effectively since the EJB container is responsible for threading of beans. In this case a single request will always be linearly executed and the possible advantage of many processors will be wasted. The use of JMS could possibly solve this but a message that you let go doesn&#39;t report back.<br /><br />Java is not the language to use with this new harware then. Without really knowing I suspect that this is about the same for C#. We need languages that support code to may run concurrently without no hard work placed on the programmer. There are probably a number of candidates for this. Nat Torkington - also for O&#39;Reilly Radar - <a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/01/threads_conside.html\">mentions</a> Erlang, Haskell and E as potential languages. Wikipedia says about Erlang that:</p><blockquote>Erlang&#39;s main strength is support for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_%28computer_science%29\" title=\"Concurrency (computer science)\">concurrency</a>. It has a small but powerful set of primitives to create processes and communicate between them. Processes are the primary means to structure an Erlang application. Erlang processes are neither OS processes nor OS threads, but lightweight threads somewhat similar to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java\" title=\"Java\">Java</a>&#39;s &quot;green threads&quot;.</blockquote><p>Interesting! The years to come will definitley see some new players challenging the dominance of Java and C# for the enterprise. The Web 2.0 toolset will be likely to get some new tools. Ajax is kind of a parallel way of writing web pages so this shift in technology may be a natural continuation of the Web 2.0 thingie.</p>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 364,"revision_id": 364,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "<p>Hi again,<br /><br />one of the recent topics on this blog was information overload. Until recently I experienced this daily within Eclipse IDE. Once your project reaches a moderate size the eclipse package explorer becomes virtually useless since you get completely lost in all the information it displays. Classes, methods, jar dependencies, project file, ... - finding something in this amount of information ended up in hour long scrolling session. I basically got to the point where I completely ignored the package explorer and just relied on the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">CTRL-R </span>and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">CTRL-T</span> keyboard shortcuts which let you search for resources respectively classes in the whole workspace.<br /><br />Admittedly my problems with Eclipse might not be relevant in the grand scheme of things, but I was still happy when I came across <a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/mylar/\">Mylar</a> and its solution to this type information overload. Mylar is based on tasks/activities and the idea is that each task starts with an empty package explorer. While you work on the task and continue opening files Mylar will build up a list of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">task relevant</span> files. Given that you normally only work on a small set of files at a time you end up with a very compact list in the package explorer. You can manually add <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">landmarks</span> to files you want to show in the package explorer or you can remove <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">landmarks</span> mylar created automatically. Last but not least, Mylar also integrates with many bug/task tracking solutions like for example <a href=\"http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/\">Jira</a>. Mylar Eclipse tasks and your currently assigned tasks from the bug tracker become one and the same thing. I call this true Agile Development :)<br /><br />I recommend everyone working with Eclipse to install Mylar. Hopefully it becomes soon the default package explorer in Eclipse.<br /><br />In case you are experiencing problems with Eclipse hanging / locking up after installing Mylar it might help to edit <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">eclipse.ini</span> and add the following:<br /><br />-vmargs<br />-server<br />-Xms40m<br />-Xmx768m<br />-XX:MaxPermSize=128m<br />-XX:+UseParallelGC<br />-XX:+UseParallelOldGC<br /><br />I work with <a href=\"http://www.exadel.com/web/portal/home\">Exadel</a> and <a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/mylar/\">Mylar</a> and noticed that without these settings that Eclipse would just hang, especially when changing editors. The only way out was to kill Eclipse. The above settings fixed this problem ( it seems to be related to the PermGen size and there are a lot of theories about this - just Google for it ;-)<br /><br />--Hardy</p>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 365,"revision_id": 365,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "<p>My coblogger <a href=\"http://www.highlevelbits.com/2007/02/wau-10-years-in-software-development.html\">recently questioned</a> the usefulness of <a href=\"http://www.secondlife.com/\">Second Life</a>. I have to agree that Second Life in its current state hardly is any fun and definitely not useful. Being a long time <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk\">cyberpunk</a> reader I like to see uses in the future that will revolutionize the Internet. It may not necessarily be Second Life that is the platform for this, new players are likely to emerge and new standards will make the thing global. To make this happen new user interaction devices need to be invented that are able to render a 3D world better than the screens we use today. A good thing with this will be that user interaction hopefully will engage the whole body - not just hands and eyes - this will bring health to computer users. Parts of the web will go three dimensional and parts will stay as they are. Second Life or something like it will be the platform for this with its virtual worlds functioning as a fundamentally different way of surfing the web. Several big companies like Sun and Reuters are using Second Life as part of their marketing scheme. I am pretty sure that this is overhyped now but in a distant future something like this will be the way to surf just like cyberpunk prophet William Gibson predicted 23 years ago in the excellent novel <a href=\"http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/books/neuromancer.asp\">Neuromancer</a>.<br /><br />[Fun | <a href=\"http://www.getafirstlife.com/\">Get a First Life</a> | via <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life\">Wikipedia</a>]</p>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 366,"revision_id": 366,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "<p>Here comes a maybe not so high level bit, but it nevertheless cost me a lost of time the other day to figure out what was going on.<br /><br />Long story short - I am recently experimenting with ruby on rails and and kept getting the following error message each single time I wanted to scaffold any of my database tables:<br /><br /><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">No such file or directory - /tmp/mysql.sock</span><br /><br />I am running Windows XP together with cygwin.

You beat me by three years.<br />I guess I owe you a beer ;-)<br /><br />Like you I thought countless times of quitting. Developing software can be a very discouraging.<br />There are more examples of how not to do it than vice versa. As Fredrik said, software<br />development has come a great way in recent years. Software patterns and XP are examples of great attempts of improving the quality of software development. However, one thing I&#39;ve learned during the last 7 years is that it always comes down to the actual people. You want good software - hire good people and pay them what they are worth. Good developers will automatically adopt best practices without being told and the usage of patterns follows naturally. Many companies still seem to think that software development is a<br />mindless task which does not require creativity and programmers are hence interchangeable.<br />I highly disagree. Software development requires a lot of creativity and good software has a lot in common with a nice piece of art.<br />I believe the model of Software Craftsmanship as described by Pete McBreen in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Software-Craftsmanship-Imperative-Pete-McBreen/dp/0201733862/\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Software Craftsmanship: The New Imperative</span></a> is a much better fit for software development.

Where is the value in sites like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/\">YouTube </a>and <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/\">MySpace</a>?. In my opinion these kind of site just create a uge <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_overload\">information overload</a> which makes it harder and harder to find relevant information on the internet. The same questions of usefulness arise for me in conjunction with <a href=\"http://secondlife.com/\">Second Life</a>. I visited Second Life recently to exprience what the whole fuzz is about and from a developer perspective I must admit the whole system is quite an achievement. What I cannot understand, however,<br />is why so many people choose to spend so much time and money in this online world?<br />For the time being the real world is at any time ways more interesting and challenging. But maybe that&#39;s just the view of a developer who believes that a program must always be &#39;meaningful&#39;.

I will write a little in this post about several things that has been or will become important for me.<br /><br />Next month I have worked in the software industry for 10 years which I think is an extraordinary accomplishment. (Party someone???) The first 3 years I worked for a product vendor into logistics and supply chain management and after that I have been a consultant working for myself and for others in different manners. I have been so tired of the way we build software so many times but still have not managed to do something else. I probably like it too much despite all the shortcomings. (And - to be honest - the pay is better than starting all over with some new trade.) Only on a few occasions have I been on projects that actually both produced usable software and also managed to produce beautiful software. With beautiful I mean well structured, purposeful, poetic and well written source code producing human user interfaces that empowers the user rather than scares them away. Instead of complaining more about this misery I would like to point out some things that made things look brighter.<br /><br />Patterns are a pretty old concept now. I read a lot about them in the late 90s and got lots of inspiration from this nice way of talking about software. (I also read the bible by Christopher Alexander on building real houses. Brilliant book.) The design patterns written by the gang of four has become the common vocabulary for most developers. A problem is that a good developer uses design and code patterns pretty much without thinking about whether it is a pattern or not. A mediocre developer may try to use patterns but may still mess things up badly. Patterns used in the wrong places may be worse than not using patterns at all. (Oops - back to complaining....) The community of the original <a href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WelcomeVisitors\">wiki</a> created by Ward Cunningham gave me lot of inspiration during these early years.<br /><br />It was also here that I first got in touch with eXtreme Programming and the ideas of Kent Beck among others. It was not a coincidence that approximately the same people that came up with design patterns also were the driving force behind the XP movement - maybe the freshest thing that has happened to software development during these 10 years. XP may be fundamentalist and way to extreme but it made way for the other agile processes - some of them already existing when XP appeared. I have been particularly fond of <a href=\"http://alistair.cockburn.us/\">Alistair Cockburns</a> work on the Crystal method. He groks that the process needs to be tailored to each projects specific needs. Depending on the project scope, the product risk and available resources the process should be different for each project. &quot;It is the least methodology that could possibly work.&quot;<br /><br />It may be a bit late to make some cheerful noise about Web 2.0 but I will nevertheless. I still remember the strange feeling of using Mosaic to surf the then tiny web from the computer labs of the <a href=\"http://www.kth.se/\">Royal Institute of Technology</a> in 1994. It was not so much the actual content but the fact that it was live data from other countries (mostly US one may suspect). A new world with new possibilities was upon us all. In the beginning it was mostly about publishing information. Interaction was rare and involved the complicated <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/CGI/\">Common Gateway Interface</a>. The first years filled with experiments. Anyone remember the abundant use of the <a href=\"http://www.siteexperts.com/tips/html/ts12/page1.asp\">blink tag</a>? Or all these <a href=\"http://www.nepthys.com/textures/\">colorful backgrounds</a> making any text on pages unreadable? And when animated gifs appeared there was a <a href=\"http://www.horton-szar.net/clipart/construction.php\">construction worker</a> on every web page that wasn&#39;t done yet. The playfulness disappeared with the dot com years. At the same time the web turned ugly. Many web pages still has the dot com look - many of them in a state of decay. During these years companies started to think about maybe integrating the web with backend systems and this was possibly the best thing that started to happen during these dark years. Today there are no airlines without an online booking system - most of them pretty good. Some other experiments didn&#39;t work. Selling groceries over the net - for example - has not been overly successful. One strange side effect of the dot com era was that many large organizations turned to web technology for all their user interfaces. Even today with all the Web 2.0 stuff around it is hard to imagine a web client that can not be done more efficiently with a rich client. I would not consider hacking Java in a web client for example. Today Web 2.0 with its &quot;just enough&quot; interfaces brings new hope to a tired developer.<br /><br />For some years I have been planning to abandon programming completely, not being satisfied with web client development with Java server technology. Last year I tried <a href=\"http://www.rubyonrails.org/\">Ruby on Rails</a> and fell for both the language and the framework at once. All the redundancies with Java programming was removed in one sweep. Consider the difference between typing:<br /><code>String someText = &quot;some text&quot;;</code><br />in Java and the Ruby equivalent:<br /><code>someText = &quot;some text&quot;</code><br />The difference is one word - &quot;String&quot; - that confuses the code line. Any developer knows that &quot;some text&quot; is a string. Stating it like this makes the assumption that &quot;some text&quot; may be something else. We need to distinguish this use of &quot;some text&quot; with the identifier String. The String does not add value or meaning to the code. (And honestly - what exactly is the point with semicolons? That character doesn&#39;t communicate.) The only point with a strongly typed language is that more tests are done at compile time. But if all programs have proper unit tests they would surely find a type conversion error and hence the need for strongly typed languages fade away. And we may all write less code for more functionality in the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","body_summary": "","body_format": "full_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "page","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 369,"revision_id": 369,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "this is about us ...","body_summary": "","body_format": "filtered_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "page","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 370,"revision_id": 370,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "Here we can be reached (twitter, email, facebook, ...)","body_summary": "Contact information","body_format": "filtered_html"}, {"entity_type": "node","bundle": "article","deleted": 0,"entity_id": 373,"revision_id": 373,"language": "und","delta": 0,"body_value": "This years long vacation trip is about to happen on monday. The four of us are going to spend 3 weeks in Japan and Korea combined and will be a great experience regardless how everything works out.  So how do you plan such a trip? The first thing is to **decide** to actually go and find cheap plane tickets as soon as possible. We did this in october and landed tickets with SAS from Arlanda via Copenhagen to Narita, Tokyo for only 5500 SEK. That felt like a bargain but was clearly the result of deciding early. 

After the decision there is plenty of time to figure out **where to go** once there. We bought one guide book for each country and started to get an overview of the countries. Tokyo and Kyoto was musts on a first trip to Japan and also one of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. We also wanted to experience onsen - hot springs combined with hotels. In Korea we decided that Seoul would be worth all of our days save one for the ancient capital of Gyeungju. In the end our schedule turned out to be 4 nights in Kyoto, 1 night in Nagasaki, 2 nights in Beppu - the capital of hot springs, night boat from Shimonoseki to Busan in Korea, one night there and then train to Seoul via the old capital, 5 nights in Seoul and finally 6 nights in Tokyo. 

Once general plans have been made it is time to **find hotels**. We were a bit late to this phase and the later you are the more time it will take. But in the end I think we have nice and not too expensive hotels in all our destinations. 

You also need to decide on **transfer**. We bought a rail pass for the first week in Japan. You have to buy it from abroad to get a good price so it is necessary to do it in advance. The rest of the train tickets we think we can buy once there. Plane tickets from Seoul to Tokyo was also a bit hard to find but a low price airline appeared in the last minute and helped us out.

The details about exactly what to do each day and where to eat and so son can be left for the travel itself. It is always good to have a general idea so you don\'t miss something you really wanted to do.

Before the trip I blogged about planning the trip so I won\'t bother you with that again. 

Both Japan and Korea are very different from Sweden and western europe. In many ways they are more modern but in other ways they stick to tradition. We tried to mix culture and history with the modern way of life and thus we time travelled through both countries starting with something old like the amazing temples of Kyoto and ending in the capitals. Both of which has this mind blowing fusion of old traditionalism and a new modern (or is it postmodern or even postpostmodern these days?) lifestyle. Lets look a bit closer on what we experienced in Japan. I realized after a while writing this piece that it would benefit from being split up in parts. This first part will be dedicated to the former capitals of Japan - Kyoto and Nara.

The buddhist and shintoist temples of Kyoto and Nara is really breathtaking. We spent a day visiting temples in Kyoto and made a day trip to Nara to do the same. Kyoto is the old capital and was home to Japans emperor until as late as 1868. True power had by then shifted to Tokyo (then named Edo) with the rise of the shogunate in the 17th century. With the Meiji restoration the emperor got some real power back and Japan opened up to foreigners after a couple of centuries of near hermetic enclosement. (Also interesting that the romanizations of these two capitals are anagrams.) Kyoto is now a modern city and not much of its glorious past is visible in the city center although there certainly is a higher penetration of shrines than in Tokyo. The most interesting temples are located to the east on a hillside and offers nice views of the city. We started our temple walk at [Sanjūsangen-dō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanj%C5%ABsangen-d%C5%8D) that had an amazing 1000 statues guarding the thousand armed Kannon. You are not allowed to take any pictures inside so here is one from the outside.

To [Kiyomizu-dera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiyomizu-dera) we hiked uphill through a cemetery - a great way to approach a shrine. This one was really sitting on the edge of the hill overlooking the cemetery and the distant city.

![kiyomizu-dera](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7268/6907629582_d169bf8798.jpg)

The third temple worthy of mention is [Ginkaku-ji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginkaku-ji) where the gardens are breathtaking and zen calmness easily settles on any visitor.

![zen garden](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7131/6907715022_f85b061d4c_z.jpg)

Nara was the capital for a brief period in the 8th century after a period where each new emperor had to live in a new place but before an emperor decided that Kyoto was the place for imperial palaces. This has left Nara somewhat less touched by developments as the ones seen in Kyoto where things have changed in many ways during its many years as the emperors home. In Nara we first visited the huge [Daibutsu-den](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Ddai-ji) - the worlds biggest wooden building where a huge buddha statue with a couple of guardian statues are the main attraction. 

![daibatsu-den](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7247/7055029613_674c19c253.jpg)

We then climbed up to [Nigatsu-dō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigatsu-d%C5%8D), a nice temple with some views over the city and the big temple below. The third and last temple of our short stay in Nara, , was maybe not that interesting in itself but for the huge amounts of stone lanterns that were present on all roads leading to it. On one approach road there were double rows of 2 metre high lanterns on both sides. It would be magical to return an evening when they are all lit.

![lanterns](http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5075/6909015502_7bb106c930.jpg)

Finally some words about the mighty peoples lodgings. We visited the imperial grounds in both Kyoto and Tokyo the latter of course still being used by the current emperor. We also visited Tokugawas fortresses in both Kyoto and Tokyo. In Tokyo it is the same site as the imperial grounds - the emperor simply moved in here when taking charge during the meiji restoration. In Kyoto it is a site in itself that was barely used by the shogun and has been more or less unused since then. Both have huge stone walls with the accompanying moat and must have been hard to penetrate.

Both Kyoto and Nara is really worth the visit and we could easily have spent more time in both cities. Next part in this travel reports series will probably be about food. Not a single meal was of poor quality or boring so look forward to an interesting post.

I have had the questionable fortune to code a bit of web using [Java](http://www.java.com/) technologies the last months. Not my choice of tech obviously but nevertheless interesting. Much has happened in the Java space since the days of [Struts](http://struts.apache.org/) - I remember doing stuff on an early beta back in 2001. It was much better than coding servlets directly. We have gone a long way since then and these days Java or the microsoft techs are not the obvious choice anymore. People are being much more productive with Ruby, Python, Groovy, Scala and even Smalltalk these days. A much better world for us developers!

Anyway - this new phase started with a bit of [Vaadin](https://vaadin.com). It is built using the same technology as in [GWT](https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/) but more backendish. You code in Java and markup, scripts and styling just appear magically in your browser. It works fine as long as you stick to the box. I was lucky to work with [Magnus Axelqvist](http://blog.crisp.se/author/magnusaxelqvist) - also a proponent of test driving and we really tried hard to do black boxing of our app using Fitnesse (as well as the fair amount of “normal” unit tests). And now dark clouds started to appear. Everything in Vaadin becomes embedded in a multitude of div elements and only some of them get an appropriate css id. What is worse though is that it is hard if not impossible to set the id yourself. The default implementation of common form widgets keeps state somewhere in the javascript engine and not visible from the outside making it impossible to get the value of a drop. We had to use a “native” implementation to get around it. A positive on the other hand is that it is very easy to write unit tests for the Java code. Although it doesn’t test the Java->HTML transformation it gives you enough security when TDDing your application. Vaadin is probably a good choice when your developer group is skilled in Java but not in web but a lot of flexibility is given away to the framework. I would not consider it for end user apps but it may work well for in house administrative stuff where functionality is more important than looks.

After the Vaadin experience it was nice to get introduced to [Wicket](http://wicket.apache.org/) - a framework with a kind of templates (actually plain HTML files spiced up with wicket:id attributes) and most of the coding still done in Java. A bit of Ajax generated in the background but still possible to hook in your own javascripts when necessary. Although it is painful to write web applications in Java, Wicket is an option where you still have lots of control over your markup.

[![markup](http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2121/2105227208_44e1536453.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/wonderlane/2105227208)

This trip made me realize that the core of the web is in the markup. HTML, Javascript and CSS is what matters in the browser. Please try to learn it instead of hiding behind a framework that takes away your markup ownership. If you are to build smashing applications for the web you need to control your markup.

Let\'s talk about running. I know, I know, I used to say that last year\'s [Berlin Marathon](http://www.highlevelbits.com/2011/09/38-berlin-marathon-and-my-first.html) was a once off: \"I just want to see whether I can run a marathon.\" 

Now in 2012 I am already signed up for [Göteborgs Varvet](http://www.goteborgsvarvet.se/), [Stockholm Marathon](http://www.stockholmmarathon.se/Start/index.cfm?Lan_ID=3) and [Midnattsloppet](http://www.midnattsloppet.com). What exactly my goal is I am not sure, but I know I am not there yet. 

Time to talk equipment tough. As with any good sport, it is all about the equipment and one important piece of running equipment (give or take the shoes) is the pulse clock. Luckily I got a Polar RS300X as a Christmas present and I like it a lot. However, as any gadget loving nerd I could not stop there. For training purposes it might be enough to know in which pulse range I am running in, but my alter ego needs to know distances. Kilometers are what counts. 

What I needed was either a GPS based Polar G1 or the Polar foot pod S1. For me the choice seemed easy. Something with a GPS in it must be so much better than a step counting thingy (I just had this little clip-ons in mind you put on your pants). However, if I would have done my research better I would have quickly learned that the S1 is much more accurate than the G1 and that you can actually start running without delay. With the G1 you sometimes have to wait several minutes before it has a signal and if you are lucky you keep the signal for the whole run (often you don\'t and wonder in the end why it felt you ran 10km, but the G1 only shows 5km). You also cannot download the actual track you were running. The G1 only measures the total distance!

The biggest frustration with the G1 I had, however, a couple of weeks ago. In the middle of the run the battery died. It was not the first time, but fair enough I could have replaced the battery earlier. The problem was, however, that once at home and with a new battery inside, the G1 refused to restart. I would turn it on and it would blink, just to turn of after about a minute. Replacing the battery did not help. There was no reset button and the manual did not mention anything like it. Even googling I drew a blank (note to self, there are questions Google does not have an answer to) My G1 was \"broken\". In the end a friend helped me with the solution. Whether I already had tried to take out the battery for a longer time and then place it back in. I am still unclear about where the difference is between just changing the the battery or taking it out, leaving the G1 without a battery for a while and then placing in a new one, BUT that was the solution. Why can Polar not write this into the manual I wonder!?

The first thing that went missing when leaving Japan is polite and smiling people. In almost every shop you are welcomed by a smiling person that says something to you. Back in Sweden it is rather the exception. Also when looking lost in a street corner with a map there is always someone trying to help. This was even more apparent in Korea than in Japan. Seoul was a bit friendlier in this resepect compared to Japan. All in all I don\'t think we met a single person that was not friendly during the trip.

The low tax on income makes it worthwhile to have small businesses which makes cities much more lively. There are so many small enterprises in both Japan and Korea that makes the countries more alive. It is also something that makes it easier to find something to eat. And yes - the food is awesome. Japanese food is of course about the fish and the rice which we had plenty. But it is also about yakitori, ramen and udon. One of the best meals was a lunch in Kyoto where we got noodles on a fry bench (griddles? - a bit lost about the english word for this....). Korean cuisine may not be that famous in the west but stands up really good. It is not only about the kimchi and it is certainly not just spicy chilliish food as the guide book said. Korean BBQ is often prepared at the table by the guests or by a chef. With meat of good quality and all the nice side dishes it makes for a really intimate way to share a meal. We also took a liking to korean breakfast. It is much the same as a \"normal\" meal but in smaller quantities. The kimchi and the ever present soup is there and maybe one smaller dish with meat or fish. Also - the ever present cup of tasty green tea. The only thing to grow tired of is all that rice.

From food it is easy to move on to cleanliness. Most restaurants give you warm or cold small wet towels to clean yourself before starting to eat. Such a nice thing to start every meal feeling refreshed especially after a couple of hours of sightseeing. Another great thing about these countries are restrooms everywhere. Every building in Japan seem to have a tidy public restroom. 

We did a bit of sampling of the Japanese onsen (bathing) culture. In Beppu we stayed at a hotel with a couple of private baths that you could book for free by the hour. True balm for the soul to sit in these warm baths and just exist for a while. We could have done much more of this side of Japan but so much to see and just 3 weeks to spend.

A nice trip and there may be more of the far east soon. Käthes youngest daughter is about to study in Shanghai for a year so maybe we will \"have to\" visit her around christmas.","body_summary": "","body_format": "markdown"}]
