Every time I travel I realize that I know several words that can be used to describe architecture. I recognize words like gothic, baroque and art noveau and I in some cases I can pick up typical works of these styles but often I am helplessly lost trying to nail a certain building to a architectural style or point in time. Hence I will here give you a short history of architecture while hoping that some of it will stick in my brain for a bit longer.

My main source - of course - will be wikipedia but I also have a couple of books at home that I will use for inspiration.

### Names

By just browsing the main article on the [history of architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_architecture) some things about how styles are named can be noticed. Styles from before the medeival age are just named the same as the civilization where they origin. Ancient egypt, greek, roman and byzantine architecture falls into this category. (How to define the difference between the words greek and byzantine may be an interesting topic but when it comes to architecture it is pretty clear.)
