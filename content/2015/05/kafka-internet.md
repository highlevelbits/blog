Interesting read about the 
[internet of kafkaesque things](https://www.aclu.org/blog/internet-kafkaesque-things?redirect=blog/technology-and-liberty/internet-kafkaesque-things) 
comparing computers with bureaucracies.

> As I argued last week, computers and bureaucracies share many similarities. Both take input in 
standardized form, process that data according to a set of rules, and spit out a result or decision.

> But they also share similar weaknesses. Computers are mentally “stiff” and prone to laughable, 
child-like errors that even the dumbest human would never make. Computers can be mindless and 
inflexible, unforgetting and unforgiving, yet simultaneously quirky and error-prone. Bureaucracies 
are also notorious for their mindless application of rules and the dumb, irrational decisions that often result.
