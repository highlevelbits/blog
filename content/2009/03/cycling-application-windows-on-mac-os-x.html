  My second Mac revelation of the week: <blockquote>cmd-~</blockquote>I was trying now for a while to figure out how to cycle the open windows of a single application. Of course I knew <blockquote>cmd-tab</blockquote>in order to cycle between different applications windows, but it always annoyed me that I couldn't cycle for exmaple my open Idea windows. Well, now I can :)<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />--Hardy
