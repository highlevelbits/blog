  Hi again,<br /><br />in the previous post I forgot to mention one thing. Ever noticed the useless java bean icon in your Dock when running java processes? Here is how you control their behavior.<br /><br />If you want to avoid them completely (like for services, eg Tomcat or JBoss) you can just pass the java.awt.property to the JVM. Something like<br /><pre><br />java -D java.awt.headless=true ...<br /></pre><br />Just find the right way of doing this in your startup script or in case you are using launchd add it to your plist file.<br /><br />In the case you actually want to have an icon, but want to have something which actually represents your application you can use the following JVM options:<br /><pre><br />java -Xdock:name=MyApp -Xdock:icon=/path/to/custom/icon.png ...<br /></pre><br />Now, I better get ready for <a href="http://jaoo.dk/aarhus-2009/">JAOO</a>. Currently I am on the ferry between Varberg and Grenå and I have seen a calmer whaether :(<br /><br />Will also meet Fredrik at <a href="http://jaoo.dk/aarhus-2009/">JAOO</a>. I am sure there will be more about this conference here shortly.<br /><br />--Hardy<div class="old-comments"><h2>Old comments</h2><div class="one-old-comment"><span class="comment-date">2009-10-05</span><span class="commenter-name">Fredrik Rubensson</span><div class="comment-body">Yep - post about the first day is already in the makings.</div></div><div class="one-old-comment"><span class="comment-date">2009-10-05</span><span class="commenter-name">Hardy Ferentschik</span><div class="comment-body">Jupp - and I am running late.
