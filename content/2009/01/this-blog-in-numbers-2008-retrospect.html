  <p>I am really into statistics a lot so here is a post about this blog and the year 2008 in numbers. Over the year we had 1774 visits generating 2096 page views.&nbsp;Traffic has almost doubled compared to 2007 (although we started in february). Geographically: 638 visits from the states, 250 from Sweden, 127 from UK, 76 from Canada, 66 from India and so on. 75% of all visits started with a Google search. The most popular article is Hardy&#39;s <a href="http://www.highlevelbits.com/2007/02/no-such-file-or-directory-tmpmysqlsock.html" id="dmrc" title="No such file or directory - /tmp/mysql.sock">No such file or directory - /tmp/mysql.sock</a> with about 20% of all page views. The second most popular article is <a href="http://www.highlevelbits.com/2007/04/svn-over-ssh-prompts-for-wrong-username.html" id="pkim" title="svn over ssh prompts for the wrong user name">svn&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; over ssh prompts for the wrong user name</a>. A reader commented: &quot;This is the greatest blog posting ever. I&#39;ve been trying to figure out this problem for hours!&quot;. Both this helpful articles are easily accesible with an error message search. The third most popular article is <a href="http://www.highlevelbits.com/2007/09/some-reasons-behind-success-of-facebook.html" id="z-l_" title="my take on the success of facebook">my take on the success of facebook</a> - a bit surprising! Firefox was used by 57% of the readers, 26% on IE and 10% on Safari. Operatins systems: 61% on Windows, 24% on Mac and 14% on Linux. All this nice statistics mad possible by <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/" id="ixoh" title="Google Analytics">Google Analytics</a>. Lets hope for 4000 visits this year!<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>
