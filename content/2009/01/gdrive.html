  <p>Funny, I just discovered Dropbox and started to rave about it and here come the first indications that Google is preparing to launch a similar service - the <a href="http://highlevelbits-ferentschik.rhcloud.com/sites/default/files/sites/default/files/images/01/first-official-description-of-gdrive.html">GDrive</a>. My guess is that GDrive will start with much more that a 2 GB free account which will put a lot of pressure on Dropbox. Let&#39;s hope that Dropbox can stay ahead in yet another rematch of David against Goliath.<br /><br />--Hardy</p>
