  <p>Here is a question for you. How come that there is no remote diff in subversion. I can use</p>
<pre class="brush: bash">
svn status -u</pre>
<br /><p>to check which files are changed remotely. But there is no similar -u option for diff. Or a --dry-run flag in update which shows the incoming diffs. Is there a reason for this? Do you not also sometimes want to know what the incoming changes are - BEFORE you issue the actual update?<br /><br />The best solution to the problem so far I found on this <a href="http://blog.chmouel.com/2007/02/06/svn-diff-against-changes-in-the-remote-repository/">blog</a>.<br /><br />Has anyone a better solution? Or an explanation why this is not part of the standard svn command set?<br /><br />--Hardy</p>
