  <p>I got the task to migrate all our code - some 100 classes - from standard <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/index.html?java/util/logging/package-summary.html">JDK logging</a> to the logging facade framework <a href="http://www.slf4j.org/">slf4j</a>. (I am not sure if there are any real benefits from such a migration but the deploying organization has decided that this is the way to go so the best approach i to just look happy and accept. They also claim that there may be performance issues with the way we log now. It sounds a bit far-fetched to me....) A fast analysis of the task made me conclude that I needed to replace:</p><div><ul><li>the import of java.util.logging.Logger with org.slf4j.*</li><li>the line constructing the Logger instance to use the slf4j LoggerFactory instead</li><li>.fine, .finer and .finest with .debug (for some reason .debug is the finest level in the slf4j API)</li><li>.warning with .warn</li><li>.severe with .error</li></ul>A tedious work to do by hand. Thankfully there is a nice little unix command called <a href="http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html">sed</a> that together with find does the trick almost perfectly. Here is the script I used:</div>
<pre>
#/bin/ksh
for file in `find . -name &#39;*.java&#39;`
do
 cleartool co -c &quot;Changing log framework thingie.&quot; $file
 sed -e &#39;s/java.util.logging.Logger/org.slf4j.*/&#39; \
     -e &#39;s/= Logger.getLogger/= LoggerFactory.getLogger/&#39; \
     -e &#39;s/.fine(/.debug(/&#39;  \
     -e &#39;s/.finer(/.debug(/&#39; \
     -e &#39;s/.warning(/.warn(/&#39; \
     -e &#39;s/.severe(/.error(/&#39; \
     $file &gt; $file.tmp
 mv $file.tmp $file
done</pre>
<div>As you can see I also added a line to check out the file from Clearcase. If you are using CVS, <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">subversion</a> or even <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> (as any developer would given a free choice....) there is no need.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>A couple of files failed to compile after the migration. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket#Curly_brackets_or_braces_.7B_.7D">Curly braces</a> disappeared at the end of some classes and in one case the logger was instantiated on 2 lines instead of one but overall it worked nicely.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>This way of working comes rather natural to me but I gather that not all developers think of the command line as a helpful tool and thus this blog post.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div class="old-comments"><h2>Old comments</h2><div class="one-old-comment"><span class="comment-date">2009-09-16</span><span class="commenter-name">Hardy Ferentschik</span><div class="comment-body">Sweet :) What would life be without sed, awk, find and grep.

Sometimes a few lines of unix scripting is all you need. But it is of course good that there are tools since many developers don't have a clue about unix.</div></div></div>
