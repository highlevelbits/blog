  My MacBook Pro turns soon 1 year and I thought I do a little health check. This includes checking where all the disk space disappeared over the last year. This is where one of my favorite Java tools come into play. I don't use it so often, but when I want to find out what takes up so much space on my drive, there is nothing better than <a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/jdiskreport/">JDiskReport</a>. In my case there were several unused VMWare images. A quick delete and I reclaimed more than 15GB! I recommend you run JDiskReport against your home directory. I am sure you will be suprised :)<br /><br />--Hardy
