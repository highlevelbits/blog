  First skydive of the year at <a href="http://www.hoppafallskarm.nu/">Fallskärmsklubben Göteborg</a> - grymt!<br />64 characters. I wonder whether I should start twittering :) ?<div class="old-comments"><h2>Old comments</h2><div class="one-old-comment"><span class="comment-date">2009-04-28</span><span class="commenter-name">Fredrik Rubensson</span><div class="comment-body">You have the gift!</div></div><div class="one-old-comment"><span class="comment-date">2009-04-28</span><span class="commenter-name">Hardy Ferentschik</span><div class="comment-body">I am not sure about this one. I think I can give Twitter a pass for now and the near future. I admit by now that it can have some use, but in the great picture it is just noise.<br /><br />--Hardy</div></div><div class="one-old-comment"><span class="comment-date">2009-04-28</span><span class="commenter-name">Fredrik Rubensson</span><div class="comment-body">The nice thing is that you control the noise level by deciding who to follow. I am following Uncle Bob, DHH, Martin Fowler and Kathy Sierra that had an interesting conversation about professionalism yesterday. That kind of stuff is great.</div></div><div class="one-old-comment"><span class="comment-date">2009-05-09</span><span class="commenter-name">Matze</span><div class="comment-body">Where are the pictures of your first drop of the year.<br /><br />I just want to partake in the wonderful view over göteburg.</div></div><div class="one-old-comment"><span class="comment-date">2009-05-09</span><span class="commenter-name">Hardy Ferentschik</span><div class="comment-body">sorry, no picture for this jump :( But others will come.</div></div></div>
