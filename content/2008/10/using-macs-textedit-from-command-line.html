  Just a short little note. As I recently mentioned there are a few things which I actually do not like about my Mac. One is that the <i>Finder</i> per default does not display hidden files and the second related issue that <i>TextEdit</i> is not in the default path of the console.<br />Why is that important you ask? Well I would like to say for example say at the command line:<br /><br />> edit foo.txt <br /><br />or <br /><br />> edit ~/.bashrc<br /><br />For the former I could open <i>Finder</i>, locate the file and double click. For the former I am pretty much out of luck. Of course I also could just use <i>vi </i>and in fact that's what I am doing most of the time, but then there are the times where I just want to have another simple editor. To come to the point, here is what I did and what I would like to share with you. Just add this to your <i>~/.bashr</i>c (or <i>~/.bash_profile </i>as a matter of fact):<br /><br />function edit()<br />{<br />    /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit $@ 2>/dev/null<br />}<br /><br />Have fun,<br />--Hardy<div class="old-comments"><h2>Old comments</h2><div class="one-old-comment"><span class="comment-date">2009-06-29</span><span class="commenter-name">Vivek</span><div class="comment-body">Alternative way to do this.<br /><br />add the following line to .bashrc:<br /><br />alias edit='open -a textmate'</div></div><div class="one-old-comment"><span class="comment-date">2009-06-29</span><span class="commenter-name">Hardy Ferentschik</span><div class="comment-body">That's of course if you have Textmate installed. <br /><br />The benefit of the simple <a href="http://www.highlevelbits.com/2009/03/open.html" rel="nofollow">open</a> command I discovered actually myself only a short while after I wrote this blog.
