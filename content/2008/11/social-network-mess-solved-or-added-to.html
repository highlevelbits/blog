  <p>How many social networks are you on? Me, myself and I hang at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/people/Fredrik-Rubensson/545428184">facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/froderik">linkedin</a>, <a href="http://www.plaxo.com/">plaxo</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/froderik/">flickr</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/froderik">twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/froderik">last.fm</a>, <a href="http://delicious.com/froderik">del.icio.us</a> and probably a couple more that I have forgotten about. All of them certainly contains slightly different information about me. Typically I update the profile when I first start the account and whatever seemed reasonable to share at the time is included. And then I don&#39;t look at the profile ever again. Yet another site called <a href="http://www.atomkeep.com/">atomkeep</a> solves this problem for us. Create an account, hook it up to all the sites you want and start synchronizing. Pros: all your profile information is managed at one site and then distributed all over the place. Cons: yet another site to keep track of and the integrity question of course. And just maybe I don&#39;t want to appear in the same way at linkedin as at facebook. But for basic information like phone numbers and email adresses it will come in handy. I will give it a try and let you know how it works out.</p>
