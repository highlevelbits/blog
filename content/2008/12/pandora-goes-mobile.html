  <p>I used the excellent music streaming service from <a href="http://www.pandora.com">Pandora </a>for several years until they decided to disable its users in Europe due to legal reasons. I then moved to <a href="http://last.fm">last.fm</a> which is good as well. The difference - if I have grasped it correctly - is that Pandora actively attribute properties to all songs whence last.fm relies on simliarities between users and seems to do this on an artist level rather than on a song level. Another - maybe more important - difference is the user interface. Pandora is really nice and slick while last.fm looks more like a normal web site. Now Pandora has launched a <a href="http://blog.pandora.com/pandora/archives/2008/12/pandora_on_wind.html">service for cell phones </a>and it looks really, really nice an I feel sad that I am not allowed to use it.... Enough said about that. I am now a <a href="http://www.spotify.com">Spotify</a> user as well and might blog a bit about that service later on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="old-comments"><h2>Old comments</h2><div class="one-old-comment"><span class="comment-date">2008-12-19</span><span class="commenter-name">Hardy Ferentschik</span><div class="comment-body">Cool. I always liked pandora. In fact I am still using it once in a while even after they closed traffic for non US residents. I basically installed <A HREF="http://foxyproxy.mozdev.org/help.html" REL="nofollow">FoxyProxy</A> and configured a US based proxy just for pandora. Unfortunately, you end up changing the proxy settings quite often if you are not going to pay for a dedicated proxy server. Being a proud owner of an original SqueezeBox and (since recently) a <A HREF="http://www.slimdevices.com/pi_boom.html" REL="nofollow">Squeezebox Boom</A> I use more and more <A HREF="http://mp3tunes.com" REL="nofollow">MP3 Tunes</A> (I pushed my personal mp3 collection to it). That said I am also a spotify user and very happy with it. However, none of these services can help you discovering new artists the way pandora can :)</div></div></div>
