  <p>Here comes another little curiosity.  In my latest two webapp projects I started to use <a href="http://struts.apache.org/2.x/">Struts2</a> as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller">MVC </a>framework. I must say I am vey happy with this framework and it it a big step forward from Struts1. <br />Especially the interceptor approach is extremely flexible. The one aspect of Struts2 which I am still struggling with is the combintation of <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/jstl/reference/docs/index.html">JSTL</a> and <a href="http://www.ognl.org/2.6.9/Documentation/html/LanguageGuide/index.html">OGNL</a>, but this might offer enough material for a whole separate blog entry. The little curiosity I wanted to write about is where I found some working documentation on (J)unit testing my Struts2 actions. Digging on a view relevant forums several approaches came up, but nothing really worked. Finally I got lucky - on a fan side for the sport clubs Raptors and Arsenal! This is the post I am referring to <a href="http://arsenalist.com/2007/06/18/unit-testing-struts-2-actions-spring-junit/">http://arsenalist.com/2007/06/18/unit-testing-struts-2-actions-spring-junit/</a>. By now I learned that the owner of the site is a Systems Analyst who is a fan of the Raptors and Arsenal. <br />Nevertheless my initial suprise when finding this blog was genuine :)</p>
