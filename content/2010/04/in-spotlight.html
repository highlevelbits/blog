  <p>Hi,<br /><br />recently I noticed that spotlight on my MacBook kept responding with very long delays. A friend recommended to only index what you really need. For me the most important feature of spotlight is to start applications, so I decided to change the settings. But how do I trigger a re-index? A little googling and I found several tips which recommend to change the index configuration in the preferences pane and then after a few minutes change it back. The idea being &quot;trick spotlight into indexing&quot;. Even though this approach probably works it just felt wrong and I decided to dig deeper. Here is what I found:</p>
<pre style="background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238); border: 1px dashed rgb(153, 153, 153); color: black; font-family: Andale Mono,Lucida Console,Monaco,fixed,monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 14px; overflow: auto; padding: 5px; width: 100%;">
<code>sudo mdutil -E /</code></pre>
<p>This command will immediately force spotlight into a re-indexing your main disc.<br />Once on the right track I found out that there is a whole range of spotlight related tools - <i>mdfind</i>, <i>mdimport</i>, <i>mdls</i> and <i>mdutil</i>. Now that&#39;s more like it. If you want to know more about these tools check out this <a href="http://www.thexlab.com/faqs/stopspotlightindex.html">Spotlight tips</a> article.<br /><br />Enjoy,<br />Hardy</p><div class="old-comments"><h2>Old comments</h2><div class="one-old-comment"><span class="comment-date">2010-04-30</span><span class="commenter-name">Emmanuel Bernard</span><div class="comment-body">A somewhat easier solution is to use the Onyx app to trigger the reindexing the UI way.</div></div></div>
