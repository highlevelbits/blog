  <p>Time for some more Mac tool recommendations. Two tools I discovered just recently and which I already don&#39;t want to miss anymore: <a href="http://visor.binaryage.com/">Visor</a> and <a href="http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/">TotalFinder</a>. Both are from binaryage.<br /><br /><b>Visor </b>is a Quake Style Terminal. I use the Terminal application (shell) a lot. Together with my IDE it is probably the most used application on my Mac. I also utilize my virtual desktops a lot. One feature I always missed on Mac was the ability to configure an app to follow a desktop switch (sticky windows under Linux). The only solution (correct me from wrong) is to open a Terminal on each desktop. That, however, does not work so well with cycling apps using the <i>Command+Tab</i> shortcut. Visor is the solution and not only do I have now my shell available on each desktop, I also get the geeky ahh-factor visor style behavior. Just try it out! The app comes with a whole range of preference options to configure your Terminal appearance.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">[[{"type":"media","view_mode":"media_large","fid":"86","attributes":{"alt":"","class":"media-image","typeof":"foaf:Image"}}]]</div><p><b>TotalFinder</b> on the other hand is an extension to Mac&#39;s Finder and allows to open multiple tabs and for example drag &amp; drop between tabs. It also has a keyboard shortcut to hide and show system files. A problem I have been writing <a href="http://www.highlevelbits.com/2009/02/switching-between-hiding-and-viewing.html">before</a> about. It also solves another problem which was annoying me a lot. The creation of this <i>.DS_Store</i> files in directories. TotalFinder has an option to collect this file into a single cache location. Nice! Ahh - and of course it comes also with this cool quake style visor behavior. Check it out!</p><p style="text-align: center;">[[{"type":"media","view_mode":"media_large","fid":"87","attributes":{"alt":"","class":"media-image","typeof":"foaf:Image"}}]]</p><p>Enjoy!</p>
