  I am using <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> for various things  - my wiki is running against it, my local <a href="http://www.sonarsource.org/">Sonar</a> installation uses it and often I run <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a> unit tests against it.  I remember installing MySQL via <a href="http://www.macports.org/">macports</a>, but since then I have not touched it. Well, until a couple of days ago, where I got strange error messages from my JDBC driver when trying to connect to a specific schema in my database. I still could connect to MySQL using the <i>mysql</i> command line though. I wanted to know more. I needed to find the mysqld configuration and error logs. But where?<br />I haven't looked at the MySQL installation for months and I was not sure where macport installed it. I remembered that the MySQL configuration file is called <i>my.cnf</i> or something <i>*.cnf</i>. I tried a quick:<br /><br /><pre style="background-color: #eeeeee; border: 1px dashed rgb(153, 153, 153); color: black; font-family: Andale Mono,Lucida Console,Monaco,fixed,monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 14px; overflow: auto; padding: 5px; width: 100%;"><code>> locate my.cnf<br />> locate *.cnf<br /></code></pre><br />Both commands gave a uge amounts of hits and I was still not sure where to look at. There must be a better way to find out which configuration the database is using and where the data is stored. I started some digging. Turns out if MySQL is still running, you can simplly issue a SQL statement to get most information you need. The key is the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/show.html"><i>show</i></a> command. You might already know <i>show databases</i> and <i>show tables</i>, but do you know:<br /><br /><pre style="background-color: #eeeeee; border: 1px dashed rgb(153, 153, 153); color: black; font-family: Andale Mono,Lucida Console,Monaco,fixed,monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 14px; overflow: auto; padding: 5px; width: 100%;"><code>show variables;</code></pre><br />This command will tell you almost all you need to know, amongst others:<br /><br /><pre style="background-color: #eeeeee; border: 1px dashed rgb(153, 153, 153); color: black; font-family: Andale Mono,Lucida Console,Monaco,fixed,monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 14px; overflow: auto; padding: 5px; width: 100%;"><code>log_error  /opt/local/var/db/mysql5/Sarmakand.local.err<br />pid_file   /opt/local/var/db/mysql5/Sarmakand.local.pid<br />datadir    /opt/local/var/db/mysql5/<br /></code></pre><br />Now I was almost there. I had found the data directories and the log file. A quick look in the log revealed something along these lines:<br /><br /><pre style="background-color: #eeeeee; border: 1px dashed rgb(153, 153, 153); color: black; font-family: Andale Mono,Lucida Console,Monaco,fixed,monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 14px; overflow: auto; padding: 5px; width: 100%;">InnoDB: Cannot find table foo from the internal data dictionary<br />InnoDB: of InnoDB though the .frm file for the table exists. Maybe you<br />InnoDB: have deleted and recreated InnoDB data files but have forgotten<br />InnoDB: to delete the corresponding .frm files of InnoDB tables?<code><br /></code></pre><br />Digging deeper I was able to restore now my database, but I still did not have a direct way to find out which configuration was used. What if the database would not have been running? Turns out you can also simply run:<br /><br /><pre style="background-color: #eeeeee; border: 1px dashed rgb(153, 153, 153); color: black; font-family: Andale Mono,Lucida Console,Monaco,fixed,monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 14px; overflow: auto; padding: 5px; width: 100%;"><code>> mysql -help</code></pre><br />Somewhere hidden in the output you will find:<br /><br /><pre style="background-color: #eeeeee; border: 1px dashed rgb(153, 153, 153); color: black; font-family: Andale Mono,Lucida Console,Monaco,fixed,monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 14px; overflow: auto; padding: 5px; width: 100%;"><code>Default options are read from the following files in the given order:<br />/etc/my.cnf /etc/mysql/my.cnf /opt/local/etc/mysql5/my.cnf ~/.my.cnf <br /></code></pre><br />BTW, if you are looking for a MySQL client for Mac - there is <a href="http://www.sequelpro.com/">Sequel Pro</a>. Not perfect, but good enough for most day to day tasks.<br /><br />So long,<br />Hardy
