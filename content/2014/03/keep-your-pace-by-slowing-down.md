This post is about slowing down. In many areas of life it seems that slowing down actually makes us go faster in the long term. I will give you a few examples of this and hopefully you will - like me - start to approach things slowly from now on.

### Running

Of course - running slowly makes it possible to run longer.

I got the idea to this post when I started a training program for being able to run half a marathon later this year. Unlike my normal style of always running at the limit of my ability this program stipulates to run slower and more often in order to get longer distances into the legs. It makes total sense. Instead of straining my body so much that I need to relax for quite some time after each run now I keep my effort at a level that is sustainable over a longer period of time. 

### Writing

When writing a piece like this one it is easy to just hurry through it to get the thoughts down in letter, words and sentences. Actually writing a bit slower makes the piece sit together better and also gives time for reflection. Also taking a break from the text is always a good thing. When you come back to it with new eyes some things still makes sense while other may need a rewrite. It is also hard to evaluate the structure of a text when being inside it bending words to the will. With  fresh outlook after a break a faulty structure is easily detected. That is because we change the perspective.

### Local maxima

The point where you are now when it comes to a skill may seem to be the perfect way to do it. And maybe it is. But it may also be a [local maxima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_and_minima). How can we found out if we are stuck at a local maxima? The only way is to slow down and evalute yourself from an outside perspective. If you are lucky you may even have a friend or colleague that can help you see things from a higher perspective and unveil the local maxima in order to suggest a path forward.

### Retrospectives

When working in a team or alone one key practice to increase the speed over time is to evaluate the wat of working regularly. I always propose this in teams I work with but I am not that good as retrospecting myself. To take a moment and list things that work and things that don't work is essential to increase the overall speed. Add slowness and afterthoughts to speed up. It may seem like a contradiction to some and it also is in the short term but for reaching a sustainable high pace and also enabling going faster it is essential.

### Harmony

So why should we bother about this?
