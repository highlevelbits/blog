Some or other discussion at work got me inspired to rant a bit about XML. So here is a short history about its origins, its promises and how it eventually turned out. In this simplified history XML has two sources of inspiration: **formal documentation** like SGML and **hypertext**, hugely popularized by HTML.

Formal documentation
--------------------

In the beginning of time (1986) there was SGML. It was defined in a standard called [ISO 8879](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=16387). The acronym stands for Standard Generalized Markup Language. It roughly means 'the mother of all markup languages' - which is not far from the truth. While SGML tried to solve every problem related to document management it also managed to become overly complex.

SGML is a tool to verify that the content of a documentation conforms to a specification or document type. XML inherited the DTD (Document Type Definition) from SGML. As strange as it may seem XML was a huge step to make formal description of documents simpler.

Hypertext
---------

In London some 30 years earlier [Mary Lee Woods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Lee_Woods) gave birth to Tim - one of four kids. He grew up to become a researcher just like his parents and eventually ended up at Cern where HTML was invented. The idea of [hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext) was not a new one.
