I keep coming back to this quote from William Gibsons [*All tomorrow's parties*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Tomorrow%27s_Parties_%28novel%29) again and again. It sums up life neatly.

> "I do not deal in outcomes."
> 
> "But you do," the voice says. "You've dealt a few for me, after all. You become an outcome."
> 
> "No," the man says, "I simply discover that place where I am supposed to be."
> 
> "You make it sound so simple. I wish that it were that simple for me."
> 
> "It could be," the man says, "but you are addicted to complexity"
