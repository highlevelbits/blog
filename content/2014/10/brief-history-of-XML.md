Some or other discussion at work got me inspired to rant a bit about [XML](http://www.w3.org/XML/). So here is a short history about its origins, its promises and how it eventually turned out. I started writing this in July 2014 and it was just recently completed. In this simplified history XML has two sources of inspiration: **formal documentation** like SGML and **hypertext**, hugely popularized by HTML.

Formal documentation
--------------------

In the beginning of time (1986) there was [SGML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language). It was defined in a standard called [ISO 8879](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=16387). The acronym stands for Standard Generalized Markup Language. It roughly means 'the mother of all markup languages' - which is not far from the truth. While SGML tried to solve every problem related to document management it also managed to become overly complex.

SGML is a tool to verify that the content of a documentation conforms to a specification or document type. XML inherited the [DTD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_type_definition) (Document Type Definition) from SGML. As strange as it may seem XML was a huge step to make formal description of documents simpler. On the other hand one may argue that the DTD is a much simpler and better way to describe a document type than the XML based [XML Schema](http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-0/) that surfaced 2001.

Hypertext
---------

In London some 30 years earlier [Mary Lee Woods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Lee_Woods) gave birth to Tim - one of four kids. He grew up to become a researcher just like his parents and eventually ended up at Cern where HTML was invented. The idea of [hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext) was not a new one though. It is an idea that evolved from the 40s and onwards where the article [As We May Think](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/?single_page=true) by [Vannevar Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush) is one early place where the machanisms of hypertext is described. That article is prophetic in [many other ways](/2014/07/visions-about-photography.html) and well worth a read in its own right. Here is a short part describing the memex - a machine thought to be handling the interconnection of things.

> Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified. The lawyer has at his touch the associated opinions and decisions of his whole experience, and of the experience of friends and authorities. The patent attorney has on call the millions of issued patents, with familiar trails to every point of his client's interest. The physician, puzzled by a patient's reactions, strikes the trail established in studying an earlier similar case, and runs rapidly through analogous case histories, with side references to the classics for the pertinent anatomy and histology. The chemist, struggling with the synthesis of an organic compound, has all the chemical literature before him in his laboratory, with trails following the analogies of compounds, and side trails to their physical and chemical behavior.

> The historian, with a vast chronological account of a people, parallels it with a skip trail which stops only on the salient items, and can follow at any time contemporary trails which lead him all over civilization at a particular epoch. There is a new profession of trail blazers, those who find delight in the task of establishing useful trails through the enormous mass of the common record. The inheritance from the master becomes, not only his additions to the world's record, but for his disciples the entire scaffolding by which they were erected.

Vannevar Bush is describing things that we now take for granted. Keep in mind though that the common usage of hyperlinked text is only about 20 years old and for most people it is something rather new.

More about the history of hypertext can be found in the [wikipedia article on the topic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_hypertext). Several other ideas was brought forward in different ways and in the 80s Tim Berners-Lee started fiddling with hypertext systems leading forward to the invention of HTML in 1990 and standardized as HTML4 in 1997.
