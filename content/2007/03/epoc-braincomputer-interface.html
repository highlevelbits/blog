  <p>Emotiv Systems has introduced a new helmet which serves as brain/computer interface and allows the user to control objects by thought. You can read more about this on <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/6166959.html">gamepost.com</a>. I am not a big gamer, in fact I haven&#39;t played a game since Diablo, but the idea still intrigues me.<br /><br />Fredrik and I recently wrote about Second Life on this blog and we agreed to stick to our first life for now, but I must admit these kind of brain/computer interfaces could get me interested again. Of course there is still a fair way to go from pushing objects around to fully control a virtual environment, but it is a first step. I would love to work for company working on these kind of interfaces. I believe unlocking the secrets of the inner workings of our brain holds the key to many more exciting applications - not at all limited to the gaming world only.<br /><br />So long<br />--Hardy</p><div class="old-comments"><h2>Old comments</h2><div class="one-old-comment"><span class="comment-date">2007-03-18</span><span class="commenter-name">Fredrik Rubensson</span><div class="comment-body">Found lots of <A HREF="http://crunchgear.com/2007/03/08/emotiv-project-epoc-sensory-gaming-for-the-masses/" REL="nofollow">pictures of this cool helmet</A> at CrunchGear (gadget and computer hardware blog).</div></div></div>
