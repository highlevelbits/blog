  <p>I just downloaded and installed <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/index.php">MAMP</a>. (Found it via <a href="http://www.php.net/">php.net</a> - brilliant site about PHP.) MAMP is a bundle of MySQL and Apache with PHP for OSX that just installs and works.... I am not sure if it could be used in a production environment. Since it is based on Apache it would probably work just fine. I will just use it for development though. For people that doesn&#39;t like command lines or is just plain lazy like me there is a widget to start and stop the servers.<br /><br />So <a href="http://www.robertpeake.com/archives/66-Why-PHP.html">why would anyone want to use PHP</a>? Surely a mystery to me. But since it is quite popular these days I figure that it could be good to touch it now and then. More specifically - I decided to use it for a static web site for a popular restaurant in <a href="http://www.sollentuna.se/">Sollentuna</a>. Initially I will only use file inclusion to get rid of redundancies - later I may put some of the data in the database and do some cool Ajax things for editing it. I wouldn&#39;t use it for anything more advanced than this though.</p><div class="old-comments"><h2>Old comments</h2><div class="one-old-comment"><span class="comment-date">2007-03-17</span><span class="commenter-name">Robert</span><div class="comment-body">Thanks for the link. Database and file includes is where it all begins. Then you discover how easy and flexible PHP is to use - and are hooked! :)</div></div><div class="one-old-comment"><span class="comment-date">2007-03-17</span><span class="commenter-name">Hardy Ferentschik</span><div class="comment-body">I am using <A HREF="http://www.easyphp.org/" REL="nofollow"> EasyPHP</A>. Also only one installer and you get Apache, MySQL and PHP. I am not sure how active this project is and I must admit that MAMP looks more professional.<BR/><BR/>I am also not a big PHP fan, but there was a time were PHP was pretty much the only scripting language you could use with most ISP. Maybe that's even still the case?<BR/><BR/>--Hardy</div></div><div class="one-old-comment"><span class="comment-date">2007-03-18</span><span class="commenter-name">Fredrik Rubensson</span><div class="comment-body">The ISP I am moving to - <A HREF="http://textdrive.com" REL="nofollow">textdrive</A>  - also supports Ruby with Rails, Perl and Python with Django so there is a wide choice. I figure PHP will be the easiest to install - it normally just works directly - my laziness shining though again... I think <A HREF="http://one.com" REL="nofollow">One</A> that I used before only has PHP and ASP - maybe different now?</div></div><div class="one-old-comment"><span class="comment-date">2007-03-22</span><span class="commenter-name">Liam McDermott</span><div class="comment-body">You might be interested in our discussion on <A HREF="http://www.webmaster-forums.net/showthread.php?p=210655#post210655" REL="nofollow">'Why PHP Sucks'</A>. We've got this insanely intelligent Computer Science student, from New Zealand, on our forum who listed the reasons, it's quite a read.<BR/><BR/>The major good point to PHP is that it's very easy. <A HREF="http://www.meganjack.com" REL="nofollow">The wife</A> managed to pick it up and make a fully working, dynamic web site within a week.<BR/><BR/>Obviously, it's better than .NET (anything's better than that), but that's an entirely different argument. :)</div></div><div class="one-old-comment"><span class="comment-date">2007-03-25</span><span class="commenter-name">Fredrik Rubensson</span><div class="comment-body">Thanks Liam for the pointer.

I had a brief encounter of PHP since a customer had implemented a web page that used PHP xtea algorithm for encryption. The person that had implemented this could not give me any info of how it was implemented and I needed to implement the encryption using Java. I searched and found the EasyPHP program and that was very easy to get up and running very quickly. After a lot of debugging of the PHP code I finally got a Java version of it working so that their PHP page could decrypt the url parameter that was sent to their PHP server.</div></div></div>
