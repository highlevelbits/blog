  <p>Just some quick notes about <a href="http://www.coupland.com/">Douglas Couplands</a> novel <a href="http://www.jpod.info/">jpod</a>. A sort of sequel to microserfs - the mustread for anyone involved with software development. jpod is about a group of game developers stuck in the jpod which is some kind of cubicle area at a video game factory. They have been working on this great skating game when one manager decides that the game needs a turtle cause his son loves this other turtle in some other game. It continues like this and is really good entertainment...<br /><br />I just found out that Canadian TV network CBC will air a <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/jpod/">TV serie</a> based on the book. &quot;jPod is a one-hour drama series with amusing and evil twists&quot; the site says. Sounds promising - definitley need to get my eyes on this serie. In the meantime I will read Couplands latest - the gum thief.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
