I have to admit it is almost too much of the good thing. I can&#39;t remember what it&#39;s like going to work so it will be a brutal awakening next Monday. I started looking at the blogs I would like to catch up with today and it seems that there are people that actually work during summer.<br /><br />I started the vacation with a lengthy week of Denmark all on my own. The Roskilde Festival was a bit wet (the entire area drenched in 20 centimeters of mud) but the music was<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/froderik/835491501/" title="Photo Sharing"><img alt="wave closeup" height="180" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1144/835491501_45bebdee17_m.jpg" style="margin: 10px; float: right;" width="240" /></a> really great. After that I turned to Jutland and a piece of Vesterhavet. It is really awesome to listen to the roaring of the mighty ocean.<br /><br />Three weeks at home was interrupted by a cruise to Riga with KÃ¤the. Riga still has remains of the Soviet era - the old town is quite similar to Visby.<br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/froderik/1093511964/" title="Photo Sharing"><img alt="distant chania from beach" height="180" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1069/1093511964_f4346b2bc9_m.jpg" style="margin: 10px; float: left;" width="240" /></a><br />A week in Chania on Crete with almost all our kids became the high mark of the doing nothingness of this vacation. Beaches and good food is not a bad thing at all. Tomatoes are so much better in Greece. Most of the food are. Sometimes it is almost like Italy. And wherever you turn - the food is good. We didn&#39;t get bad food even in the most obvious tourist traps.<br /><br />So with this much vacation I will be glad to meet my customer on monday and to arrange yet another low level network evening.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="old-comments"><h2>Old comments</h2><div class="one-old-comment"><span class="comment-date">2007-08-14</span><span class="commenter-name">Hardy Ferentschik</span><div class="comment-body">Very nice indeed - and I was wondering where you were ;-)</div></div></div>
