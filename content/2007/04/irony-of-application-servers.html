  <p>At my current client I have been developing for WebLogic 8 the last year although there has been a number 9 around for quite some time. My next project will probably use WebLogic 9 after all the inhouse framework has made their move to the new platform. Isn&#39;t it ironic then that WebLogic 10 is already released? (<a href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=44841">According to TheServerSide</a>.) Maybe not more than the fact that JBoss is for free and equivalent for all uses I know of.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
