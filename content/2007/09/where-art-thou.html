  <p>Wau, that was quite a bit since I posted for the last time. I guess saying that I was busy is probably a lame excuse. However, I am not quite sure anymore what to think about the advice of people like Chad Folwer. In his otherwise very entertaining book &quot;<a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/mjwti/" id="axw0" title="My Job Went to India">My Job Went to India</a>&quot; he recommends amongst other things to:<br />&nbsp;</p><ul><li>&#39;Let your voice be heard&#39; - meaning write a blog</li><li>&#39;Release your code&#39; - meaning contribute to open source</li><li>&#39;Practise, Practise, Practise&#39; - by for example participating in <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/" id="q3:j" title="Top Coder">Top Coder</a> competitions</li></ul><br /><p>All these things make perfect sense, but put them on top of a (at least) 40 hours working week, a girlfriend and a quite time consuming hobby like <a href="http://www.skydive.se/" id="xa7:" title="skydiving">skydiving</a> and you soon wish the day would have 48 hours :)<br /><br />I learned quickly I just had do one thing at the time and for the last couple of months I decided to work on point two of the above list. So I got involved into <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/410.html" id="lqoa" title="Hibernate Search">Hibernate Search</a> which combines two great Java technologies, namely <a href="http://hibernate.org/" id="r::c" title="Hibernate">Hibernate</a> and the search engine <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/" id="zj53" title="Lucene">Lucene</a>. To be honest my contributions were rather modest, but nevertheless I am proud of the fact that Hibernate Search just a couple of days ago released its first &#39;GA&#39; release. If you want to know more have a look at <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=46995" id="ekqz" title="this article">this article</a> on The Server Side. If you are even more interested have a look the blog <a href="http://blog.emmanuelbernard.com/" id="weiv" title="No Relation To...">No Relation To...</a><br /><br />I am not sure where this all is leading me, but right now I am just happy that I finally wrote again a few lines :)<br /><br />--Hardy</p>
