  <p>Interesting <a href="http://chadfowler.com/2006/12/27/the-big-rewrite">stuff from Chad Fowler</a> on why doing the Big Rewrite may be a bad idea. My current customer has failed all attempts at doing Big Rewrites - actually not a single old system has been replaced in the last 10 years despite numerous attempts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
