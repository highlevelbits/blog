  <p>Ever used <a href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-profiles.html" id="qa.l" title="profiles">profiles</a> in <a href="http://maven.apache.org/" id="w263" title="maven">maven</a>? Great stuff. Ever tried to trigger multiple profiles? Great in theory, but unfortunately in this case maven is not delivering what one would expect - especially when you have the the same properties in multiple profiles and you want the values of the &#39;last&#39; profile activated to be the effective ones. This is exactly how <i>settings.xml </i>works. If a profile in <i>settings.xml</i> is activated and it defines a property which was already set by another profile it overrides its value. Not so with multiple profiles defined in <i>pom.xml</i>. Say we have to two profiles default and override defined as follows in <i>pom.xml</i>:</p>
<pre>
&lt;profile&gt;
  &lt;id&gt;default&lt;/id&gt;
  &lt;properties&gt;
  &lt;test&gt;DEFAULT&lt;/test&gt;
  &lt;/properties&gt;
&lt;/profile&gt;

&lt;profile&gt;
  &lt;id&gt;override&lt;/id&gt;
  &lt;properties&gt;
  &lt;test&gt;OVERRIDE&lt;/test&gt;
  &lt;/properties&gt;
&lt;/profile&gt;
</pre>
<p>Running the build via:</p>
<pre>
&gt; mvn install -P default,override
</pre>
<p>one would expect that the value for property test is &#39;OVERRIDE&#39;, but it is not :( It turns out there is a <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MNG-2309" id="wolv" title="bug in maven">bug in maven</a> which causes the order of the profile activation to be undetermined. The good news is that this particular problem is solved - in version 2.1-alpha! This means until maven 2.1 is available watch out when trying to use profile overriding. It can save you a few hours of tearing at your hair trying to figure out why the build is not behaving the way you want it to behave.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
