  <p>Awesome blog <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a> has published the <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/2007surveyresults">results of a web design survey</a> answered by close to 33,000 web designers. Lots of demographics has been gathered to get an overview of the field.<br /><br />Snapshots: the table showing salary range by longevity field reveals that 59,8% of those with less then one year of experience makes less then $20K while 54,1% of those with 9-10 years experience makes more than $60K. Folks working for the government are less likely to quit. Project managers and information architects are most satisfied with what they are doing (&gt;50%) while web masters are least satisfied (40,3%). And like this it goes on and on. One interesting fact is that a salary between $40K and $60K is the most satisfying. It is as satisfying to earn more then $100K as it is to earn between $20K and $40K.<br /><br />An interesting report with interesting conclusions. A must read for any recruiter in the field. The report is available for free: <span style="font-style: italic;">The attached report shares everything we learned. We offer it freely to this community that has given us so much.</span></p>
