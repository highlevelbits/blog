<p>For one sinatra based web site I am messing with I needed a cache for calls to third party APIs. I had used <a href="http://redis.io/">redis</a> before together with <a href="http://resquework.org/">resque</a> at a client gig so it was a natural choice for this task. Essentially I needed to use URLs as keys and the returned content for that URL as the value.</p>

<p>Installing redis is easy on arch:</p>

<pre><code>pacman -S redis 
</code></pre>

<p>It hooks in nicely with <code>systemctl</code> so you can</p>

<pre><code>systemctl start redis
systemctl enable redis 
</code></pre>

<p>to have it up and running after reboots.</p>

<p>For integrating with Ruby there is a nice gem called <code>redis</code>. Install it with:</p>

<pre><code>gem install redis
</code></pre>

<p>or put it in your Gemfile for use with bundler.</p>

<p>Now we are ready to start using <code>redis</code>. My use case is the simplest possible with strings for both keys and values. To start interacting with redis you need a client instance:</p>

<pre><code>redis = Redis.new host: '127.0.0.1'
</code></pre>

<p>This creates a client with all the defaults trying to connect with redis on the default port <code>6379</code>. On my server I have a restrictive firewall running so I had to specify talking to an IP address rather than the default <code>localhost</code>. It is also possible to start redis listening to a socket instead of a port. This may be a bit faster.</p>

<p>Now we can put some stuff into the database:</p>

<pre><code>redis.set 'some_random_key', 'value'
redis.expire 'some_random_key', 60 * 60 * 24
</code></pre>

<p>If I want to save the value forever only the first line is needed. But since this is a cache I had to add the second line to get a 24 hour expiry time on the item.</p>

<p>Now the key will be available for 24 hours and the be removed. To retrieve the value is just as easy:</p>

<pre><code>redis.get 'some_random_key'
</code></pre>

<p>I coded this up on the commute to work one day and installed it on the server the next. Really easy and useful. I certainly will consider redis as a database candidate for real work in the future. Using it as a cache is nice but it seems capable of being you main persistance store if you are into NoSQL stuff.</p>

<p>Also - it is really fast.</p>
