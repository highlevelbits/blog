<p>I have had the opportunity to familiarize myself with mariadb lately. Mariadb is an open source clone of the popular mysql relational database - now owned by oracle. It was very easy to get up and running on arch linux. Just a matter of:</p>

<pre><code>sudo pacman -S mariadb
sudo systemctl enable mysqld
</code></pre>

<p>and it was up and running. However after a while I was unable to log on with the command line tool. I learned how to start the database with the <code>--skip-grant-tables</code> and found out that the <code>user</code> table mariadb uses for authentication was empty. Since my use of mariadb is only temporary I decided to not care so much about why this happen. Instead I decided to make sure that the database always starts with the mentioned flag. To do this you need to find the files <code>systemctl</code> uses for managing its tasks. They (some of them at least) are located in <code>/usr/lib/systemd/system</code>. There seems to be one file for each thing <code>systemctl</code> is managing. I found <code>mysqld.service</code> and added the <code>--skip-grant-tables</code> flag to the <code>ExecStart</code> key. Like this:</p>

<pre><code>ExecStart=/usr/bin/mysqld --pid-file=/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid --skip-grant-tables 
</code></pre>

<p>So now my database starts without wanting authentication for connections. This is practical in a local development environment but should of course never be used in production.</p>
