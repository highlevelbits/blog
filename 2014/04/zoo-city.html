<p>In the middle of reading the immense Game of Thrones serie 
I decided to take a break and read something else and my 
eyes fell on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7163862-zoo-city">Zoo City</a> 
by Lauren Beukes that I bought as part of a 
<a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/">Humble Bundle</a> a while ago.
It turned out to be a nice break from high fantasy. In Zoo City
lives people that somehow did something wrong and as a result ended
up being attached to an animal. The main character Zinzi carries around a
sloth.</p>

<p>The stories nemesis is attached to a huge alligator and so on. Having an animal
is seen as a stigma by other persons in society so they tend to live 
in their own areas. Zinzi gets a lot of help from her sloth.
Whenever she is embarking in dubious directions the sloth tries to stop her.
With the animals (I think) also comes a magical skill. Zinzi 
can feel persons missed things so she makes a living out of helping people
find stuff that they have lost. The main story evolves around finding a
missing person and all kinds of intricate turns of events that such a 
weird setting can offer. Enough said about that - read it to find out 
what happens….</p>

<p>An interesting side plot is Zinzis other work. Being in debt to some criminal
element she works it off by reading and answering scam email replies. She
also impersonate persons that is described in the scam to get more money
out of scam victims. Normally this line of work is seen as something done
by the scum of the earth. But Zinzi is the hero in this story so this 
makes the scam work feel like a normal work. Brillantly done.</p>
