<p>I got a request for recruitment by email. And as usual the recruiter has determined that I fit a certain role very well. In this case and as always there are no consideration whether the role fits me. The recruiter asked me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I believe that your profile matches the requirements for this role. And
I´am contacting you to hear if this role is consistent with your
background, and if so, are you interested to be presented to my client?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and my response:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is indeed true that my profile matches this role. Also important to
figure out is if the role matches me. (A thing recruiters seldom
consider.) And in this case (as with a large number of similar requests
over the years) it does not. Going from freelancing to being an employed
gun for hire is not tempting at all.</p>
