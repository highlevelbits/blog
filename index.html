    <p>As <a href="highlevelbits.com/2013/08/italian_infrastructure.html">already reported</a> we spent a couple of weeks in Italy this summer. In Milan we went to Museo Poldi-Pezzoli, once the home of a wealthy family and now turned into a museum with a really nice selecton of paintings. I like these smaller museums. It is possible to view most of the works without getting overwhelmed. This time I fell for a painting by Fransesco Guardi (a new acquaintance for me) called <strong>Architectural Caprice with Roman Ruins</strong>. The painting shows a ‘normal’ life by the sea and upon that some large roman ruins are added. I liked the sense of how time passes but life goes on and also how the work of the ones before us still dwell among us. The ruins may be seen as a symbol for our history continuously putting its mark on our life.</p>

<p>The painting can be <a href="http://www.museopoldipezzoli.it/en/node/700">viewed online</a> at the museos web site. All rights reserved so can’t be shown here. The following paintings comes from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org">wikimedia commons</a>.</p>

    <p>We were fortunate enough to spend a couple of weeks in Italy. A great country always worth returning to. I read a book during the vacation about how Italy managed to become one. Seems like it was mostly a piedmontesian project when it started. Most of Italy were not that keen on the idea. Somehow they managed to pull it through but it is good to keep in mind that the different country parts have very different background, history and culture. Even the food changes a lot as you travel around. We focused on northern italy this time. We decided to go about by train and stayed in 4 cities during our trip. In this post I will show some nice shots of infrastructure (in a broad meaning) I took during the trip. Lets start in Milan with a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/froderik/9374266046/">nice old tram</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7324/9374266046_980a707e2e_c.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>And a <a href="www.flickr.com/photos/froderik/9376268864">strong moon</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2879/9376268864_440e3dd733_c.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>From Milan we moved on for some sun and waves at the nice little town <a href="http://www.comune.sestri-levante.ge.it/">Sestri Levante</a> about an hour from Genoa. Built on a former island <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/froderik/9469229505">narrowly corrected</a> with the mainland it was a nice place for a amateur photographer.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3665/9469229505_b921f1f9e1_c.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We also had some good timing with the sun that produced this <a href="www.flickr.com/photos/froderik/9472019882">awesome view</a> one of the evenings.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3753/9472019882_eebc3586ed_c.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We moved on to Genoa (or Genova as the locals spell it). This former mechant republic used to compete with Venice on the high seas. Contrary to Venice it still is one of the important ports in Italy. We took a walk down to the 500 year old lighthouse for some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/froderik/9471054149">views of the modern harbor</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7299/9471054149_dfe7864733_c.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Genoa is built where the mountains meet the mediterranean so there is a <a href="www.flickr.com/photos/froderik/9471062411">need for tunnels</a>. One of my best shots during the trip.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5499/9471062411_78b6535c78_c.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>From Genoa we continued to Bologna via Cinque Terre. It rained to we couldn’t explore the 5 villages by the sea properly. But you’ll get <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/froderik/9477777932">the idea</a> anyway…..</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2832/9477777932_651841f59d_c.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>And <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/froderik/9477788986">another tunnel</a>!</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2855/9477788986_de2afcf87a_c.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Bologna is an awesome city. Despite being old and like an old museum it still is lively. Likely due to its very old university still going strong. Much of the streets in the inner city got colonnades which us just an <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/froderik/9487213376">awesome</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/froderik/9484436291">thing</a> to have in a city. </p>

<img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2819/9484436291_3428fb4370_c.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>After Bologna we turned north and spend a couple of days in Innsbruck and München on our way home. All in all a good trip. All the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/froderik/">pictures from the trip</a> can be found at flickr.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jollino/5736137535"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2182/5736137535_dee0bcbd61.jpg" style="float:right"></a> I need to write a little piece on freedom. Recent affairs regarding surveillance carried out by a huge democracy and self proclaimed defender of freedom has made me think. No new splendid thoughts - just a reminder of some important things. </p>

<p>In a distant past the Internet was a place where anyone could share information using open standards. The infrastructure of the internet creates a place where information is published and interchanged at will but controlled by the user. Lets call this the <strong>personal internet</strong>. As the personal internet grew and proved useful for the masses so did the business value of having a corporate presence on the internet. This shift started to happen about 15 years ago and is probably not complete yet. Lets call this the <strong>corporate internet</strong>. </p>

<p>The corporate internet is made up of many different business interests. There are <em>old</em> companies that increasingly do their business using the web. Different industries have reached different levels of maturity. Some industries have embraced the net fully and do most of their business netwise while other industries are more physical in nature and so will only use the web for parts of their business anyway. Then there are new companies that have as their sole business idea to do things on the web. Some of them has grown rather big and are now full blown multinational corporations with all that comes with it.</p>

<p>It is likely that data communications always has been monitored by government agencies but the shift towards the corporate internet surely has made it harder to control for the individual. We all give away much of our data and our interactions to big players like facebook, apple and google. And these companies do not use open standards for these interchanges. If you want to communicate with a facebook user you are doomed to be a facebook user yourself. Far from the open and highly distributed mechanisms of email for example. (Or news if anyone remembers?) And most of us just don’t care at all. Convenience makes it so easy compared to freer alternatives.</p>

<p>(Sidenote: yes I am aware that facebook uses open standards like HTTP and HTML to communicate with its users. The point here is that they are not using an open standard for the communication between users.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nolifebeforecoffee/124659356"><img src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/1/124659356_bbe1e5b661.jpg" style="float:left"></a> In comes surveillance. As soon as we give away the infrastructure of our interactions to business interests we also give away the control over access to those interactions. Suddenly it is someone else’s corporate decision whether to give away my information to a government agency or not. In the old world it used to be a court order that could enforce surveillance. Sure - the web of open standards can also easily be compromised by whomever wants to listen in. Me for one don’t care much about that since nothing I write is sensitive in any way. It is a matter of principles. I shouldn’t be afraid to say <em>anything</em> anywhere on the internet. The authorities should not listen in. It reduces my freedom.</p>

<p>All in all - we really need to <em>abandon</em> social networks and internet companies that are not using open standards for communication. We should be able to use whatever software we like to interact with each other. The <em>corporate internet</em> needs to be controlled by the standards of the <em>personal internet</em>. <strong>Don’t let them reduce our freedom.</strong> Start today by looking at <a href="https://prism-break.org/">this list of alternative solutions</a> and start using the thing that hurts the least. </p>

<p>(And yes - I am a pharisee writing this on my Apple computer. And I will probably post it on one or several proprietary social networks. Sorry about that…)</p>

<p><em>Those great photos are in the open domain under nice licenses for non-commercial use. The chess board photo is by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jollino/">Daniele Nicolucci</a> and the surveillance one is by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nolifebeforecoffee/">nolifebeforecoffee</a>. Flickr users that use flattr gets one from me whenever I favorite a photo.</em></p>
