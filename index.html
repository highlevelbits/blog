  <p>For one sinatra based web site I am messing with I needed a cache for calls to third party APIs. I had used <a href="http://redis.io/">redis</a> before together with <a href="http://resquework.org/">resque</a> at a client gig so it was a natural choice for this task. Essentially I needed to use URLs as keys and the returned content for that URL as the value.</p>

<p>Installing redis is easy on arch: </p>

<pre><code>pacman -S redis 
</code></pre>

<p>It hooks in nicely with <code>systemctl</code> so you can </p>

<pre><code>systemctl start redis
systemctl enable redis 
</code></pre>

<p>to have it up and running after reboots.</p>

<p>For integrating with Ruby there is a nice gem called <code>redis</code>. Install it with:</p>

<pre><code>gem install redis
</code></pre>

<p>or put it in your Gemfile for use with bundler.</p>

<p>Now we are ready to start using <code>redis</code>. My use case is the simplest possible with strings for both keys and values. To start interacting with redis you need a client instance:</p>

<pre><code>redis = Redis.new host: '127.0.0.1'
</code></pre>

<p>This creates a client with all the defaults trying to connect with redis on the default port <code>6379</code>. On my server I have a restrictive firewall running so I had to specify talking to an IP address rather than the default <code>localhost</code>. It is also possible to start redis listening to a socket instead of a port. This may be a bit faster.</p>

<p>Now we can put some stuff into the database:</p>

<pre><code>redis.set 'some_random_key', 'value'
redis.expire 'some_random_key', 60 * 60 * 24
</code></pre>

<p>If I want to save the value forever only the first line is needed. But since this is a cache I had to add the second line to get a 24 hour expiry time on the item.</p>

<p>Now the key will be available for 24 hours and the be removed. To retrieve the value is just as easy:</p>

<pre><code>redis.get 'some_random_key'
</code></pre>

<p>I coded this up on the commute to work one day and installed it on the server the next. Really easy and useful. I certainly will consider redis as a database candidate for real work in the future. Using it as a cache is nice but it seems capable of being you main persistance store if you are into NoSQL stuff.</p>

<p>Also - it is really fast.</p>

  <p>I got myself a <strong>Nexus 5</strong> just before christmas. It was about time to replace me Nexus S - a phone that I have been happy with and not really saw a reason to switch out. Since there is no truly open choice when it comes to mobiles (not one that seems to also work….) I decided to continue with Nexus. This is my third. I also had a Nexus One before the S. I posted <a href="http://highlevelbits.com/2010/03/notes-on-my-nexus-one.html">some notes on the Nexus One</a> back in january 2010. It was my first Android so there is a lot in there that may seem self evident nowadays. Still - it has only been 4 years… One wonders where mobiles will be in 2018? Now I will just stick to the differences between my previous two nexuses and this new one.</p>

<p>It is <strong>big</strong>. I can barely use it with one hand which kind of sucks. When holding it in one hand I can not reach the opposite upper corner with my thumb. It turns out that this is ok when using it with my left hand but in the right hand there are several apps that got a menu top left that is unreachable. Another effect of this is that you’ll have to place the desktop icons you actually use to the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p>It is <strong>fast</strong>. Everything is much faster. Browser, GPS, music streaming, app starting - it all is much faster.</p>

<p>The <strong>screen</strong> is also big. This is the biggest advantage of the phone. It is actually meningful to watch video in this device. The resolution is good enough to make it a good alternative to the television set. When I lay down in my sofa and hold the phone in front of me it is the same <em>visual</em> size as the television set. No difference there. The screen size also makes the device better for reading. This is mostly because you don’t need tyo scroll as often.</p>

<p>The <strong>battery</strong> is internal which worried me a bit initially. I bought an extra battery for my Nexus S to make it possible to go on long geocaching trips. However the battery time of this phone is really good. I haven’t had one case of it running out yet despite doing many battery intensive things in a day.</p>

<p>The <strong>camera</strong> is good and fast. I may actually start to use it. I did snap a lot with a Nokia I had way back but since then I haven’t had the inspiration - just the occasional ‘must take’ pic. I bring my <em>real</em> camera whenever I want to take proper shots. It is a bit limiting to be sure so maybe that will change. The nice (if I may say so) <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/froderik/11684236696/">photo below</a> is taken with the camera on a walk yesterday.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3801/11684236696_7a7a4c6121_b.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>As it should be - this is the best phone I have had.</p>

<p>(<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/40133358@N05/6261970884">Photo by gagam13</a>)</p>

<p>I just finished moving a rails thing from <a href="https://heroku.com">heroku</a> to my own <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">arch linux server</a> at <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">digital ocean</a>. This has involved learning lots about server management. Setting up the server with decent security (ufw - uncomplicated firewall to the rescue) and a nginx web service talking to the unicorn-powered rails application. All rather easy and with lots of resources available on the interwebz. I didn’t find much about backing up a postgres database though so I figured something out on my own. And here it is! My requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>nightly backups is enough (for now - users may lose latest updates)</li>
  <li>backups must be stored on another server</li>
  <li>backups on that other server should be encrypted</li>
</ul>

<p>This leaves me with 4 tasks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>create a backup file</li>
  <li>encrypt the backup file</li>
  <li>upload the encrypted file to another server</li>
  <li>schedule a nightly task to initiate the backup</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="create-a-backup-file">Create a backup file</h3>

<p>Postgres comes with the easy to use <code>pg_dump</code> command. Name your database and the file you want to export to:</p>

<pre><code>pg_dump -f &lt;filename&gt; &lt;database&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to export all databases in your postgres server you can use the <code>pg_dumpall</code> command instead and omit the database name. I created a filename with a timestamp so that there will be no file name conflict:</p>

<pre><code>date +%Y.%m.%d.%H.%M.%S
</code></pre>

<p>plus a suffix.</p>

<h3 id="encrypt-the-backup-file">Encrypt the backup file</h3>

<p><code>gnupg</code> provides with encryption. Easily installed with</p>

<pre><code>pacman -S gnupg
</code></pre>

<p>I settled for symmetric encryption with a hard password. </p>

<pre><code>gpg --symmetric --batch --passphrase &lt;password&gt; --force-mdc &lt;backupfile&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>--symmetric</code> flag says to encrypt symmetrically. This means that we can decrypt with the same password. <code>--batch</code> makes it possible to pass in the passphrase on the command line rather than getting a prompt to enter it. <code>--force-mdc</code> makes sure that a warning about mdc is avoided when decrypting. I am not sure what this means. The command creates a file in parallell to the backup file with the added <code>.gpg</code> extension.</p>

<h3 id="upload-the-encrypted-file-to-another-server">Upload the encrypted file to another server</h3>

<p>This can be done in many ways. I settled for dropbox mostly because it is free and rather easy to do. Even easier would be something like <code>sftp</code> if you have the luxury of having another server for backup storing. To communicate with dropbox I use the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core">Core API</a> with Ruby. </p>

<pre><code>gem install dropbox-sdk
</code></pre>

<p>To use it you need to register an app with dropbox. Then you will get the key and secret needed to initiate communication and get an access token. To get the access token you will need to run the following once:</p>

<pre><code>require 'dropbox_sdk'

flow = DropboxOAuth2FlowNoRedirect.new(APP_KEY, APP_SECRET)
url = flow.start
puts url
</code></pre>

<p>Go to the outputted url logged in as the user you want for dropbox and grab the code. Pass it in to the method below:</p>

<pre><code>code = gets.strip
access_token, user_id = flow.finish code 
</code></pre>

<p>This access token can then be reused for all subsequent calls.</p>

<p>Then do the actual file transfer with:</p>

<pre><code>client = DropboxClient.new access_token
file = open gpgfilename
response = client.put_file(gpgfilename, file)
</code></pre>

<p>and the file ends up in the <code>Apps/&lt;yourappname&gt;</code> folder.</p>

<p>I use Ruby here but there are several other options depending on your setup.</p>

<h3 id="schedule-a-nightly-task">Schedule a nightly task</h3>

<p>Finally I put all the above in to one huge ruby file (that I won’t share because it is kinda messy). Then I added it to crontab with </p>

<pre><code>export EDITOR=vim
crontab -e
</code></pre>

<p>I always fail with vi…. The line to add for a nightly run at 01:37 is:</p>

<pre><code>37 1 * * * /path/to/backup.sh
</code></pre>

<p>Keep in mind that cron executes with <code>/bin/sh</code> so make sure to test your command under those circumstances. Cron is supposed to send mails when it fails. That remains to set up. I will probably rather hook the job up with nagios once I get that up and running for monitoring.</p>

<p>Thats it for now. I will come back with more server side tips further on.</p>
