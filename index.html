  <p>So I am currently back coding Java. It is two months into the current assignment and about time to report some findings. The product I work on (yes - a real product that is <strong>released</strong>) is a desktop application written with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_%28Java%29">Swing</a> - this GUI framework of Java that seems to be almost abandoned. But it is the choice you have when doing desktop with Java. (I have no idea whethere this is better or worse with other languages. Probably not for cross platform stuff. This <a href="http://qt-project.org/">qt</a> thing might be a contender though.) It sure is possible to do good stuff with it. In this code base I have mostly been saved from interacting directly with Swing due to several abstractions (of varying quality) built on top of it. Some things have been really nice to use. Adding another menu item is done in no time at all. Sometimes it goes in the way. We tried to remove a tab from an editor window and it wasn’t possible to even understand how to do it in a couple of hours. The code base is a bit old but still remarkable stable despite a clear lack of automated tests. (Yes - we are increasing the numbers.) So that is a little background to what I am doing at the moment. A couple of reflections on this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Java is the language I know best and it is really easy to just get going with it despite not having coding it for more than a year. Some skills seem to stick.</li>
  <li>inheritance sucks.</li>
  <li>interfaces may be handy if you use them consistently.</li>
  <li>the lack of enforced dependencies between packages in Java makes any code base a big soap.</li>
  <li>abstractions may make you go faster once you understand them.</li>
  <li>testing is hard. We tried to use <a href="https://code.google.com/p/fest/">Fest</a> underneath the <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm">JVM flavour of Cucumber</a>. It looked promising but than we got weird problems with running tests on the build server so we abandoned it for a while in favor of automated tests under the hood instead. </li>
  <li>the current code base is entangled so we always need to do a fair bit of mocking when setting up a test.</li>
  <li>since most of the code is uncovered by test we try to write unit tests for bigger units then classes so we cover as much as ground as possible with a single test. This has been working really fine. It is important to put the mocks in the right place for an interaction under test. </li>
  <li>in a statically typed, compiled language even a system that has too few tests can have a some stability.</li>
</ul>

<p>I will stay in Javaland for another 2 months. It is nicer than I expected. </p>

<p>I also found out that there is a <a href="http://www.javaland.eu/en/javaland-2014.html">german conference</a> called Javaland. Not for me but in case you want to go I give you a nice banner.</p>

  <p>For one sinatra based web site I am messing with I needed a cache for calls to third party APIs. I had used <a href="http://redis.io/">redis</a> before together with <a href="http://resquework.org/">resque</a> at a client gig so it was a natural choice for this task. Essentially I needed to use URLs as keys and the returned content for that URL as the value.</p>

<p>Installing redis is easy on arch: </p>

<pre><code>pacman -S redis 
</code></pre>

<p>It hooks in nicely with <code>systemctl</code> so you can </p>

<pre><code>systemctl start redis
systemctl enable redis 
</code></pre>

<p>to have it up and running after reboots.</p>

<p>For integrating with Ruby there is a nice gem called <code>redis</code>. Install it with:</p>

<pre><code>gem install redis
</code></pre>

<p>or put it in your Gemfile for use with bundler.</p>

<p>Now we are ready to start using <code>redis</code>. My use case is the simplest possible with strings for both keys and values. To start interacting with redis you need a client instance:</p>

<pre><code>redis = Redis.new host: '127.0.0.1'
</code></pre>

<p>This creates a client with all the defaults trying to connect with redis on the default port <code>6379</code>. On my server I have a restrictive firewall running so I had to specify talking to an IP address rather than the default <code>localhost</code>. It is also possible to start redis listening to a socket instead of a port. This may be a bit faster.</p>

<p>Now we can put some stuff into the database:</p>

<pre><code>redis.set 'some_random_key', 'value'
redis.expire 'some_random_key', 60 * 60 * 24
</code></pre>

<p>If I want to save the value forever only the first line is needed. But since this is a cache I had to add the second line to get a 24 hour expiry time on the item.</p>

<p>Now the key will be available for 24 hours and the be removed. To retrieve the value is just as easy:</p>

<pre><code>redis.get 'some_random_key'
</code></pre>

<p>I coded this up on the commute to work one day and installed it on the server the next. Really easy and useful. I certainly will consider redis as a database candidate for real work in the future. Using it as a cache is nice but it seems capable of being you main persistance store if you are into NoSQL stuff.</p>

<p>Also - it is really fast.</p>

  <p>I got myself a <strong>Nexus 5</strong> just before christmas. It was about time to replace me Nexus S - a phone that I have been happy with and not really saw a reason to switch out. Since there is no truly open choice when it comes to mobiles (not one that seems to also work….) I decided to continue with Nexus. This is my third. I also had a Nexus One before the S. I posted <a href="http://highlevelbits.com/2010/03/notes-on-my-nexus-one.html">some notes on the Nexus One</a> back in january 2010. It was my first Android so there is a lot in there that may seem self evident nowadays. Still - it has only been 4 years… One wonders where mobiles will be in 2018? Now I will just stick to the differences between my previous two nexuses and this new one.</p>

<p>It is <strong>big</strong>. I can barely use it with one hand which kind of sucks. When holding it in one hand I can not reach the opposite upper corner with my thumb. It turns out that this is ok when using it with my left hand but in the right hand there are several apps that got a menu top left that is unreachable. Another effect of this is that you’ll have to place the desktop icons you actually use to the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p>It is <strong>fast</strong>. Everything is much faster. Browser, GPS, music streaming, app starting - it all is much faster.</p>

<p>The <strong>screen</strong> is also big. This is the biggest advantage of the phone. It is actually meningful to watch video in this device. The resolution is good enough to make it a good alternative to the television set. When I lay down in my sofa and hold the phone in front of me it is the same <em>visual</em> size as the television set. No difference there. The screen size also makes the device better for reading. This is mostly because you don’t need tyo scroll as often.</p>

<p>The <strong>battery</strong> is internal which worried me a bit initially. I bought an extra battery for my Nexus S to make it possible to go on long geocaching trips. However the battery time of this phone is really good. I haven’t had one case of it running out yet despite doing many battery intensive things in a day.</p>

<p>The <strong>camera</strong> is good and fast. I may actually start to use it. I did snap a lot with a Nokia I had way back but since then I haven’t had the inspiration - just the occasional ‘must take’ pic. I bring my <em>real</em> camera whenever I want to take proper shots. It is a bit limiting to be sure so maybe that will change. The nice (if I may say so) <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/froderik/11684236696/">photo below</a> is taken with the camera on a walk yesterday.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3801/11684236696_7a7a4c6121_b.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>As it should be - this is the best phone I have had.</p>
