  <p>As our loyal readers surely remembers we have touched upon the subject of virtual reality and alternative input devices before. This was a common theme in the first year of this web log. Back in february 2007 when we launched I posted <a href="2007/02/whats-that-noise-about-second-life.html"><em>Whats that noise about Second Life?</em></a> with this analysis:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am pretty sure that this is overhyped now but in a distant future something like this will be the way to surf just 
like cyberpunk prophet William Gibson predicted 23 years ago in the excellent novel Neuromancer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>7 years later and it has not come true. Yet. I haven’t really followed the area lately so when the news of Facebook buying <a href="http://www.oculusvr.com/">Oculus VR</a> (along with Sony releasing a similar device) appeared on my radar I thought it fun to explore a bit more. Apparently indie game superstars Mojang <a href="http://notch.net/2014/03/virtual-reality-is-going-to-change-the-world/">were in talks with Oculus to launch minecraft</a> into their virtual environment. It seems like these talks were in an early phase and naturally notch et al did not like the idea of talking with facebook instead and ended to collaboration efforts right away. That is sad because getting minecraft into a VR platform would certainly kick start things right away. On the other hand - facebook clearly see the technology as mature enough to bet on and that may be a good sign for virtual reality overall. </p>

<p>The guy above is trying out the Oculus Rift. Isn’t it still a bit big? I get steampunkish feelings! Something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4154/4989019868_d23e79b65c_z.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Oculus was <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/">kickstarted</a> into existance. Some of its backers may feel a bit disillusioned after the facebook acquisition as <a href="https://twitter.com/avestal">Andrew Vestal</a> summed up over on twitter:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p>"I Kickstarted the Oculus Rift, what do I get?" You get a lesson in how capitalism works.</p>— Andrew Vestal (@avestal) <a href="https://twitter.com/avestal/statuses/448603100387872768">March 25, 2014</a>

<p>Not unsurprisingly Sony is on the move and unveiled Morpheus at GDC just some weeks ago. It looks slicker (as you would expect) but is basically the same deal conceptually and technically. While it is now possible to get virtual reality visuals there is still lots of work to be done when it comes to interacting with this world. Most of the examples I have seen in my short googling session involves either a classic console controller or some kind of wii-like pointer thing.</p>

<p>Another fun post to reread 7 years later is <a href="2007/04/gartner-on-virtual-worlds.html"><em>Gartner on virtual worlds</em></a> where I bashed a ridiculous prophecy by gartner that by 2011 80% of internet users will have a second life in one of the emerging virtual reality platforms. That didn’t come true - not because it is a bad idea but because interface technologies weren’t mature enough for it. the average user is not impressed by a virtual world accessed via the standard keyboard/mouse/screen peripherals. New ways to interact with computer and cloud is a must to get somewhere when it comes to virtual reality. Also important is the killer application that makes us all want to get inside. I doubt that it will be facebook that delivers this killer application but you never know. Given their huge user base anything can happen. And we will surely continue the <a href="2013/08/freedom.html">miserable path of proprietary protocols</a> for human interaction.</p>

<p>I leave you with this good overview of the current state of affairs compiled by the verge:</p>

  <p>So I am currently back coding Java. It is two months into the current assignment and about time to report some findings. The product I work on (yes - a real product that is <strong>released</strong>) is a desktop application written with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_%28Java%29">Swing</a> - this GUI framework of Java that seems to be almost abandoned. But it is the choice you have when doing desktop with Java. (I have no idea whethere this is better or worse with other languages. Probably not for cross platform stuff. This <a href="http://qt-project.org/">qt</a> thing might be a contender though.) It sure is possible to do good stuff with it. In this code base I have mostly been saved from interacting directly with Swing due to several abstractions (of varying quality) built on top of it. Some things have been really nice to use. Adding another menu item is done in no time at all. Sometimes it goes in the way. We tried to remove a tab from an editor window and it wasn’t possible to even understand how to do it in a couple of hours. The code base is a bit old but still remarkable stable despite a clear lack of automated tests. (Yes - we are increasing the numbers.) So that is a little background to what I am doing at the moment. A couple of reflections on this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Java is the language I know best and it is really easy to just get going with it despite not having coding it for more than a year. Some skills seem to stick.</li>
  <li>inheritance sucks.</li>
  <li>interfaces may be handy if you use them consistently.</li>
  <li>the lack of enforced dependencies between packages in Java makes any code base a big soap.</li>
  <li>abstractions may make you go faster once you understand them.</li>
  <li>testing is hard. We tried to use <a href="https://code.google.com/p/fest/">Fest</a> underneath the <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm">JVM flavour of Cucumber</a>. It looked promising but than we got weird problems with running tests on the build server so we abandoned it for a while in favor of automated tests under the hood instead. </li>
  <li>the current code base is entangled so we always need to do a fair bit of mocking when setting up a test.</li>
  <li>since most of the code is uncovered by test we try to write unit tests for bigger units then classes so we cover as much as ground as possible with a single test. This has been working really fine. It is important to put the mocks in the right place for an interaction under test. </li>
  <li>in a statically typed, compiled language even a system that has too few tests can have a some stability.</li>
</ul>

<p>I will stay in Javaland for another 2 months. It is nicer than I expected. </p>

<p>I also found out that there is a <a href="http://www.javaland.eu/en/javaland-2014.html">german conference</a> called Javaland. Not for me but in case you want to go I give you a nice banner.</p>

        <a href="2014/02/using-redis-as-cache-with-ruby.html">Using redis as a cache with Ruby</a>
      </h2>

  <p>For one sinatra based web site I am messing with I needed a cache for calls to third party APIs. I had used <a href="http://redis.io/">redis</a> before together with <a href="http://resquework.org/">resque</a> at a client gig so it was a natural choice for this task. Essentially I needed to use URLs as keys and the returned content for that URL as the value.</p>

<p>Installing redis is easy on arch: </p>

<pre><code>pacman -S redis 
</code></pre>

<p>It hooks in nicely with <code>systemctl</code> so you can </p>

<pre><code>systemctl start redis
systemctl enable redis 
</code></pre>

<p>to have it up and running after reboots.</p>

<p>For integrating with Ruby there is a nice gem called <code>redis</code>. Install it with:</p>

<pre><code>gem install redis
</code></pre>

<p>or put it in your Gemfile for use with bundler.</p>

<p>Now we are ready to start using <code>redis</code>. My use case is the simplest possible with strings for both keys and values. To start interacting with redis you need a client instance:</p>

<pre><code>redis = Redis.new host: '127.0.0.1'
</code></pre>

<p>This creates a client with all the defaults trying to connect with redis on the default port <code>6379</code>. On my server I have a restrictive firewall running so I had to specify talking to an IP address rather than the default <code>localhost</code>. It is also possible to start redis listening to a socket instead of a port. This may be a bit faster.</p>

<p>Now we can put some stuff into the database:</p>

<pre><code>redis.set 'some_random_key', 'value'
redis.expire 'some_random_key', 60 * 60 * 24
</code></pre>

<p>If I want to save the value forever only the first line is needed. But since this is a cache I had to add the second line to get a 24 hour expiry time on the item.</p>

<p>Now the key will be available for 24 hours and the be removed. To retrieve the value is just as easy:</p>

<pre><code>redis.get 'some_random_key'
</code></pre>

<p>I coded this up on the commute to work one day and installed it on the server the next. Really easy and useful. I certainly will consider redis as a database candidate for real work in the future. Using it as a cache is nice but it seems capable of being you main persistance store if you are into NoSQL stuff.</p>

<p>Also - it is really fast.</p>
