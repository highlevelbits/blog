  Arghh, I really have it now with all these new highly praised new gadgets. Is it too much to ask for some decent quality control in the hard- and software industry? First my <a href="http://www.highlevelbits.com/2010/08/swollen-macbook-pro-battery.html">MacBook battery starts swelling</a> up and I get told that this is a "security measurement" and now my few months old HTC Desire thinks it has to reboot every couple of hours, sometimes even going into a reboot frenzy up to 10 reboots in a row. First I thought it must have been my fault and I tried to uninstall applications, change settings, read log files, .... Nada! Now I found <a href="http://www.htcdesireforum.com/htc-desire-troubleshooting/desire-keeps-rebooting/">this thread</a> on the <a href="http://www.htcdesireforum.com/">HTC Desire Forum</a>. Turns out I am not the only one with rebooting problems and it very much looks like a hardware problem.<br>I never liked my HTC when it comes to making calls. I love my apps, but as phone my new "smartphone" sucks. And now I cannot rely on making any calls at all anymore. The phone might just decide to reboot while in the middle of call. Awesome! <br>Was the promise not that life will become easier with all these gadgets? For me it really does not feel that way. It feels I am spending more time trying to bypass shortcomings of these gadgets than I gain by the new "possibilities". It's just an endless energy drain. Time to call the HTC support. Let the fun begin ...
