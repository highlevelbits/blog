Hi again,<br><br>in the previous post I forgot to mention one thing. Ever noticed the useless java bean icon in your Dock when running java processes? Here is how you control their behavior.<br><br>If you want to avoid them completely (like for services, eg Tomcat or JBoss) you can just pass the java.awt.property to the JVM. Something like<br><pre><br>java -D java.awt.headless=true ...<br></pre>
<br>Just find the right way of doing this in your startup script or in case you are using launchd add it to your plist file.<br><br>In the case you actually want to have an icon, but want to have something which actually represents your application you can use the following JVM options:<br><pre><br>java -Xdock:name=MyApp -Xdock:icon=/path/to/custom/icon.png ...<br></pre>
<br>Now, I better get ready for <a href="http://jaoo.dk/aarhus-2009/">JAOO</a>. Currently I am on the ferry between Varberg and Grenå and I have seen a calmer whaether :(<br><br>Will also meet Fredrik at <a href="http://jaoo.dk/aarhus-2009/">JAOO</a>. I am sure there will be more about this conference here shortly.<br><br>--Hardy<div class="old-comments">
