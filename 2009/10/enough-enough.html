<p>This year would be the 5th winter in a row in Sweden for Anna and me. Clearly not an attractive thought. For this reason we decided to follow the sun.<br><br>I don't want to spill the beans as yet about where the journey will take us, but I am hoping to be able to spice this blog up with some exclusive travel reports.<br><br>As a little teaser I am posting a popular landmark of the city we will be traveling to:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">[[{"type":"media","view_mode":"media_large","fid":"107","attributes":{"alt":"","class":"media-image","typeof":"foaf:Image"}}]]<br> </p>
<p>Does anyone know which city this is? Or maybe you've been there and can give us some travel tips?<br><br>--Hardy</p>
