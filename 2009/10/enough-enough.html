<p>This year would be the 5th winter in a row in Sweden for Anna and me. Clearly not an attractive thought. For this reason we decided to follow the sun.<br /><br />I don&#39;t want to spill the beans as yet about where the journey will take us, but I am hoping to be able to spice this blog up with some exclusive travel reports.<br /><br />As a little teaser I am posting a popular landmark of the city we will be traveling to:</p><p style="text-align: center;">[[{"type":"media","view_mode":"media_large","fid":"107","attributes":{"alt":"","class":"media-image","typeof":"foaf:Image"}}]]<br />&nbsp;</p><p>Does anyone know which city this is? Or maybe you&#39;ve been there and can give us some travel tips?<br /><br />--Hardy</p>
