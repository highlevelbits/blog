  sed to the rescue (or how to migrate from java.util.logging to org.slf4j)
</h2>

<p>I got the task to migrate all our code - some 100 classes - from standard <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/index.html?java/util/logging/package-summary.html">JDK logging</a> to the logging facade framework <a href="http://www.slf4j.org/">slf4j</a>. (I am not sure if there are any real benefits from such a migration but the deploying organization has decided that this is the way to go so the best approach i to just look happy and accept. They also claim that there may be performance issues with the way we log now. It sounds a bit far-fetched to me....) A fast analysis of the task made me conclude that I needed to replace:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>the import of java.util.logging.Logger with org.slf4j.*</li>
<li>the line constructing the Logger instance to use the slf4j LoggerFactory instead</li>
<li>.fine, .finer and .finest with .debug (for some reason .debug is the finest level in the slf4j API)</li>
<li>.warning with .warn</li>
<li>.severe with .error</li>
</ul>A tedious work to do by hand. Thankfully there is a nice little unix command called <a href="http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html">sed</a> that together with find does the trick almost perfectly. Here is the script I used:</div>
<pre>
#/bin/ksh
for file in `find . -name '*.java'`
do
 cleartool co -c "Changing log framework thingie." $file
 sed -e 's/java.util.logging.Logger/org.slf4j.*/' \
     -e 's/= Logger.getLogger/= LoggerFactory.getLogger/' \
     -e 's/.fine(/.debug(/'  \
     -e 's/.finer(/.debug(/' \
     -e 's/.warning(/.warn(/' \
     -e 's/.severe(/.error(/' \
     $file &gt; $file.tmp
 mv $file.tmp $file
done</pre>
<div>As you can see I also added a line to check out the file from Clearcase. If you are using CVS, <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">subversion</a> or even <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> (as any developer would given a free choice....) there is no need.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A couple of files failed to compile after the migration. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket#Curly_brackets_or_braces_.7B_.7D">Curly braces</a> disappeared at the end of some classes and in one case the logger was instantiated on 2 lines instead of one but overall it worked nicely.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This way of working comes rather natural to me but I gather that not all developers think of the command line as a helpful tool and thus this blog post.</div>

Sometimes a few lines of unix scripting is all you need. But it is of course good that there are tools since many developers don't have a clue about unix.</div>
