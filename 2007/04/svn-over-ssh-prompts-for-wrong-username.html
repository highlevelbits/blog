  <p>It is time again for one of these rather low level bits :)<br>The company I am currently working for uses subversion as version control system. The server is setup to use <span style="font-style: italic;">svn+ssh</span> protocol only. Initially I tried to access the source code like this:</p>
<pre>
svn --username hardy.ferentschik checkout svn+ssh://servername/projectname/trunk
</pre>
<p>For some reason svn would then always prompt me for a password for</p>
<pre>
hardy@servername</pre>
<p>, where hardy is my user name on the local machine. I couldn't really figure out what was going on. It seemed that the user name specified via <span style="font-style: italic;">--username</span> was not getting passed to the ssh client. I then tried:</p>
<pre>
svn checkout svn+ssh://hardy.ferentschik@servername/projectname/trunk</pre>
<p><span>which worked fine. I completely forgot about this problem for a while. Until yesterday that is. I wanted to configure a <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.0/ch07s03.html">svn:external</a> link from one project to another in order to be able to check them out into the same directory. svn:external works similar to <a href="http://ximbiot.com/cvs/wiki/index.php?title=CVS--Concurrent_Versions_System_v1.12.12.1:_Reference_manual_for_Administrative_files#Ampersand_modules">cvs ampersand modules</a> and can be a very useful feature.<br><br>For the svn:external property I couldn't use the url with my username in it, </span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span>since then everyone checking out the project would have to authenticate with my credentials. Not really a solution. I had to use </span><span style="font-style: italic;">svn+ssh://servername/projectname/trunk</span><span>. But now of course my problem re-appeared.<br><br>First I tried to find a solution in the svn documentation and on the svn forums, but there is really only the <span style="font-style: italic;">--username</span> option. I was already close to giving up when I thought that if I just could tell ssh which user to use. That was the right path and after a little more search I found out about the <a href="http://www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man5/ssh_config.5.html">config</a> file in the <span style="font-style: italic;">.ssh </span>directory. I've never used it before so I did not even know that it existed. Anyway, the simple solution to my problem was to create a <span style="font-style: italic;">config</span> file in my <span style="font-style: italic;">.ssh</span> directory and putting the following in:
<pre>Host servername
User hardy.ferentschik
</pre>
<br>That fixed the problem :) I still would claim that there must be a bug in the svn client implementation when using <span style="font-style: italic;">--username</span> together with <span style="font-style: italic;">svn+ssh</span>. Surely it should pass the user name on to ssh.<br><br>I hope this might help someone with similar problems.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Hardy</span></p>
