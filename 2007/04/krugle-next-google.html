<p>There is a new player on the search engine market - <a href="http://krugle.com/">Krugle.</a> Is it going to replace Google? Well, not really. Especially since it targets only a niche group - software developers.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">With Krugle, developers can easily find code, fix problems, learn new things and share knowledge, making them more efficient and more effective. Krugle helps professional developers solve their programming problems.</span><br /><br />I cannot remember how exactly I stumbled across Krugle in the first place. It might have been a <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot </a>article several months ago. Krugle was still in a beta state. I signed up for a beta account in order to check it out, but was initially quite disappointed. The database seemed smaller than expected and the interface was sluggish. I completely forgot about this new search engine.<br /><br />Only recently I &#39;rediscovered&#39; Krugle and must say that it has come a long way. The interface is much more web 2.0 ;-) and it seems Krugle has managed to index most open source projects I usually use (and many many more). Now, if I want to know how for example Hibernate implements a certain feature I get my answer within a few seconds by searching on Krugle. And have you ever been interested to see how other programming languages work? Well, just search Krugle&#39;s database for ASP, JavaScript, Java, C, C++, ... I am sure you will find something interesting.<br /><br />I for my part added Krugle to my developer toolbox and can only recommend anyone to have a look at it as well.<br /><br />Happy Krugling :)<br />Hardy</p>
