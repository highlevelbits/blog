<p>After being away from the feeds for a while I just now found that <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2007/04/my_favorite_gra.html">Kathy Sierra have declared</a> that she will stop doing Creating Passionate Users - at least for a while - due to a number of death threats and other sick postings both in the comments of her blog and elsewhere on the web. This is really sad news for me. I have read this blog for quite some time and it has been one core element for me when it comes to believing in what we - as software developers - are doing.</p>
<p>Most of the stuff we produce is pure crap with no beauty and often no structure. Sometimes it turns out to be good for our users - sometimes not. Kathy has provided a vision about how things could be which has been very refreshing. So I really hope that she will return to the scene in some manner as soon as possible.</p>
