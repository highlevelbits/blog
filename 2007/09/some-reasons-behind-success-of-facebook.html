<p>It is time to write some about <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">facebook</a> - the fastest growing social networking site right now. I have been using it for several weeks now that many of my friends in sweden has started using it. It started out as a networking site for college students but has opened up for anyone lately. In August it had some 19 million unique visitors compared to the 60 million accessing myspace. <span style="font-size:85%;">[according to <a href="http://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.showArticleHomePage&amp;art_aid=67685">this article</a>]</span> So why is facebook such a success? I have been using it for some weeks now and here is some reasons I see. <span style="font-weight: bold;">[1. it really looks good</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">]</span> So what is the secret behind facebooks success? Compared to <a href="http://www.myspace.com/">myspace</a> it is really good looking. But myspace may be one of the worst looking web apps there is out there. <span style="font-weight: bold;">[</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. anyone can extend it</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">]</span> Ok - maybe not anyone but anyone with some skill in HTML can extend it which has resulted in a multitude of good, not-so-good and really bad applications for the platform. With this kind of extensibility it really is a platform. Some might call it a framework. Read more in the <a href="http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/Getting_started_guide">developer wiki</a>. The business counterpart of facebook - LinkedIn - <a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/blog/2007/06/the-linkedin--1.html">announced in June</a> that they will release an API as well. This is surely made to counter facebook. <span style="font-weight: bold;">[</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. it is addictive</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">]</span> As <a href="http://ypulse.com/archives/2007/09/weve_always_was.php">ypulse notices</a> there are concerns about possible negative effects on productivity. But new things are addictive for a while and then it turns out if they are useful. If so people continue to use them because they are needed - if not - they die. <span style="font-weight: bold;">[</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">4. anyone can extend it revisited]</span> Another cool thing with the extensibility is that existing social networking sites like del.icio.us, ilike, last.fm, flickr, flixster and so on are adding facebook integration. This may be the biggest reason of the success of facebook - you can use it as it is and you can access and alter your 3 other favorite social networking sites. And your friend can see your web presence in one place.</p>

Since then I received already 10 new invitations. Not that I mind, but I must say so far has facebook failed to impress me. And what is wrong with keeping track of friends and contacts in a good old address book (be it electronic or the good old filofax). All I need is name, email and maybe phone number.<br><br>Anyone wants to bet how long it takes until Google buys Facebook?<br><br>--Hardy</div>

But then I think: what if facebook is not "yet another social networking site" but rather a new platform? Well - we don't know yet.... (Funny - it is the same kind of dicussion we had about second life - isn't it?)</div>

The feeling of not being "social isolated" i also think is one of the main reasons why Facebook is such a success.<br>I found this article wich also discripes it in a good way:<br><a href="http://www.famalb.com/?p=33" rel="nofollow"> The success of Facebook</a>
