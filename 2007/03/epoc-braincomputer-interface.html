  <p>Emotiv Systems has introduced a new helmet which serves as brain/computer interface and allows the user to control objects by thought. You can read more about this on <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/6166959.html">gamepost.com</a>. I am not a big gamer, in fact I haven't played a game since Diablo, but the idea still intrigues me.<br><br>Fredrik and I recently wrote about Second Life on this blog and we agreed to stick to our first life for now, but I must admit these kind of brain/computer interfaces could get me interested again. Of course there is still a fair way to go from pushing objects around to fully control a virtual environment, but it is a first step. I would love to work for company working on these kind of interfaces. I believe unlocking the secrets of the inner workings of our brain holds the key to many more exciting applications - not at all limited to the gaming world only.<br><br>So long<br>--Hardy</p>
