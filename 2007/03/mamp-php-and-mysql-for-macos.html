  MAMP - PHP and MySQL for MacOS

<p>I just downloaded and installed <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/index.php">MAMP</a>. (Found it via <a href="http://www.php.net/">php.net</a> - brilliant site about PHP.) MAMP is a bundle of MySQL and Apache with PHP for OSX that just installs and works.... I am not sure if it could be used in a production environment. Since it is based on Apache it would probably work just fine. I will just use it for development though. For people that doesn't like command lines or is just plain lazy like me there is a widget to start and stop the servers.<br><br>So <a href="http://www.robertpeake.com/archives/66-Why-PHP.html">why would anyone want to use PHP</a>? Surely a mystery to me. But since it is quite popular these days I figure that it could be good to touch it now and then. More specifically - I decided to use it for a static web site for a popular restaurant in <a href="http://www.sollentuna.se/">Sollentuna</a>. Initially I will only use file inclusion to get rid of redundancies - later I may put some of the data in the database and do some cool Ajax things for editing it. I wouldn't use it for anything more advanced than this though.</p>

Also only one installer and you get Apache, MySQL and PHP. I am not sure how active this project is and I must admit that MAMP looks more professional.<br><br>I am also not a big PHP fan, but there was a time were PHP was pretty much the only scripting language you could use with most ISP. Maybe that's even still the case?<br><br>--Hardy</div>

I figure PHP will be the easiest to install - it normally just works directly - my laziness shining though again...

I had a brief encounter of PHP since a customer had implemented a web page that used PHP xtea algorithm for encryption. The person that had implemented this could not give me any info of how it was implemented and I needed to implement the encryption using Java. I searched and found the EasyPHP program and that was very easy to get up and running very quickly. After a lot of debugging of the PHP code I finally got a Java version of it working so that their PHP page could decrypt the url parameter that was sent to their PHP server.</div>
