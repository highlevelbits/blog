<p>I finally got invited to <a href="http://www.freebase.com/">Freebase</a> - yet another open source content web site a la <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">wikipedia</a>. (Meaning user driven content.) So what's new here? Contrary to wikipedia and the web as it is today - information is typed. This is really cool. I added a topic called "Fredrik Rubensson". A topic is what OO people would call an instance. A topic can be of several types - my topic example is both a Person and a Software Developer. Every type come with a set of attributes that are smashed together on the topic page to create a united view. And - of course - every attribute can be related to a type and get its possible value from that. I tried to add Movie as a type - it worked just fine and I got a long list of attributes related to movies. The interface is intuitive and nice to work with. Text fields have auto completion that makes it easy to find types and topics.<br><br>Drawbacks? As with wikipedia - my instinctive reaction is - will this really work? It is similar to wikipedia but requires an extra level of analysis from its editors that most people just don't have. The result may be a mess of types and topics. But being normally pessimistic about people I think I will try the contrary this time and just think it will work.<br><br><a href="http://www.freebase.com/">Freebase</a> is still in early alpha version. If you want to join you need to sign up at the homepage<br>and get invited eventually. Or you may ask me to invite you when I get the chance. The interface suggests that I will have invitations to use later.</p>
