<p>Sticking to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-Computer_Interface">Human Computer Interface</a> theme here, I thought I share the following link with you: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-DqZ8jAmv0">Photosynth demo</a>. The demo shows new and innovative ways to work with large datasets and is based on two main software components, namely <a href="http://labs.live.com/Seadragon.aspx">Seadragon </a>and <a href="http://labs.live.com/photosynth/">Photosynth</a>. When I watched the demo I immediately had to think about Surface which we talked about previously. I am not sure how and if these projects are connected and whether or not they share some code, but the demos are just sweet :)<br><br>I would love to get some hands on experience with either Surface or Photosynth to see how much is reality right now and how much is still vision. I don't want to imply anything here, but for me there was always a slight mismatch between what Microsoft promised and what it delivered in the end ;-)</p>

The way the cathedral was build up from the collective stack of photos - truly amazing. All these new sites with collectively shared data will produce lots of applications like this one I am sure. If I could only come up with the killer one....</div>
