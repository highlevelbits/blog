<p>Actually I am on vacation right now, jumping out of airplanes. If you ever are in Sweden and you want to give it a try check out the <a href="http://www.skydive.se/">Stockholm Skydiving Club</a> in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Gryttjom,+Sweden&amp;sll=60.283068,17.496414&amp;sspn=0.159979,0.6427&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=60.289194,17.480621&amp;spn=0.159949,0.6427&amp;z=11&amp;om=1">Gryttjom</a>. It&#39;s a really great dropzone :)<br /><br />But as you can see I couldn&#39;t resist the temptation to have a quick peek on the net. I am almost ashamed - I do not last for a whole week without access to the internet ;-)<br /><br />A friend send me a link to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/">Microsoft Surface</a> and I thought I have to pass it on since we talked about human computer interaction before. I am not a big Microsoft fan, but what they show on this site is quite impressive. I cannot wait until these kind of interfaces are available. Just wondering though how they deal with fatty fingers. It seems the days where I could tell everyone off to NOT touch my screen are drawing to an end :)<br /><br />&quot;...And once you have tasted flight, you will walk the earth with your eyes turned skywards, for there you have been, and there you long to return...&quot; - Leonardo da Vinci<br /><br />Bugger - and the next time I want to write something I should FIRST read the other new blog entries since Fredrik is damn fast :)</p><div class="old-comments"><h2>Old comments</h2><div class="one-old-comment"><span class="comment-date">2007-06-06</span><span class="commenter-name">Fredrik Rubensson</span><div class="comment-body">Can't live with the Internet - can't live without it.... A bit funny that we write about the same subject - cool stuff indeed - and both making a nod of hesitation and maybe respect towards microsoft.... But the fatty finger problem still reamains. Videos just show clean male 40 somethings without fatty fingers. (Probably right before lunch....)<BR/><BR/>Have some great skydiving man!</div></div><div class="one-old-comment"><span class="comment-date">2007-06-14</span><span class="commenter-name">sdfdf</span><div class="comment-body">Hey guys, this I remember seeing about two years ago on youtube. It was displayed by some university. I guess MS bought that idea!</div></div></div>
