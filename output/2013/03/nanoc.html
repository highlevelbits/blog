<p>Time to move on to the bright (old) new world of static sites. We were not
entirely satisfied with drupal. Not knowing (or wanting to know) the platform
well made us unable to produce the awesome site we want high level bits to be.
In comes nanoc - what you read here is generated by nanoc. The source is all
available at github so if you want to contribute a post just pull request away.</p>
