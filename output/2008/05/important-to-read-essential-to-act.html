<p>I just recently finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Naked-Ape-Superspecies-Humanity-Eco-Crisis/dp/155365031X">From Naked Ape to Superspecies</a> which a friend of mine recommended on her blog, but let her speak for herself:<a href="http://littlebiggirladventures.blogspot.com/2008/01/profoundly-important-book.html"> LittleBigGirl&#39;s adventures away from home: A profoundly important book.</a><br /><br />I just want to join her appeal and recommend - even urge- everyone to get hold of a copy of this excellent book. It is no secret that we bit the hand that feeds us, but to which extend it happens and how systematically we destroy planet earth is incomprehensible. It is time we rethink our value systems and start acting responsible. If everyone takes a small step it will be a giant leap for planet earth ;-)</p>
