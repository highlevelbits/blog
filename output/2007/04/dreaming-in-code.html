<p>I just finished reading <a href="http://www.dreamingincode.com/"><span style="font-style: italic;">Dreaming in code</span></a> and I only can recommend it to everyone. It is rare to find a book about software development which combines captivating story telling with sound technical knowledge. <span style="font-style: italic;">Scott Rosenberg </span>tells the story of <span style="font-style: italic;">Chandler - </span>the wannabe killer app by the <a href="http://www.osafoundation.org/">Open Source Applications Foundation</a> - while exploring topics like Mythical Man-Month, Turing Test, Halting Problem, &#39;GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach&#39; and many many more. But above all <span style="font-style: italic;">Dreaming in code </span>managed to draw my attention to Joel Splosky&#39;s Blog - <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/"><span style="font-style: italic;">Joel on software</span></a>.<br /><br />Joel&#39;s blog offers a wide range of essays covering various aspects of software development, eg <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000024.html">Big Macs vs. the Naked Chef</a> which talks about the danger of methodologies:<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">What&#39;s the moral of the story? </span><b style="font-style: italic;">Beware of Methodologies. </b><span style="font-style: italic;">They are a great way to bring everyone up to a dismal, but passable, level of performance, but at the same time, they are aggravating to more talented people who chafe at the restrictions that are placed on them. It&#39;s pretty obvious to me that a talented chef is not going to be happy making burgers at McDonald&#39;s, precisely </span><i style="font-style: italic;">because</i><span style="font-style: italic;"> of McDonald&#39;s rules.</span><br /><br />This expresses so much how I feel about methodologies at the moment and goes hand in hand with another of Joel&#39;s essays - <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html">The law of leaky abstractions</a> </span>whose main point is that in spite of more and more abstractions we develop it is becoming harder and harder to be a proficient programmer, because at some stage any abstraction will break and you are forced to understand the underlying layer.<br /><br />The bottom for me - good programmers are rare, but they are the ones which will make a project a success with or without methodologies.<br /><br />So long,<br />Hardy</p><div class="old-comments"><h2>Old comments</h2><div class="one-old-comment"><span class="comment-date">2007-04-27</span><span class="commenter-name">Fredrik Rubensson</span><div class="comment-body">Wow - dreaming in code - it sums up the way it feels when something cool is being shaped into being. The code just hangs around you all the time... Definitley have to read that book.<BR/><BR/>Have seen pointers to Joel for a while but never managed to get there myself. I guess I have to now... It is really wise to beware of methodologies - they screw things up and gets in the way mostly. Sometimes they can at the most manage to get a project from disaster to mediocracy but they never play a part in creating something astonishing. Even less -something really beautiful.</div></div></div>
